This file contains links to the adversarial outputs on Dropbox from the attack on the WCNN and LSTM.

Note these text files are quite messy. 

Each Output email outputs as the following.

The first three lines are:
Original Label 1 OR Original Label 0 (Note 0 means spam, 1 means ham)
Original words: 
ORIGINAL TEXT

Then, if the attack failed:
Attack failed: Not enough valid neighbouring words
OR
Attack failed:Initial predicted label was wrong

If the attack was successful:
LeiAdvEx
PERTURBED TEXT
ChaNGed LaBEl YESSS (optional, if the attack caused misclassification)
Note though "ChaNGed LaBEl YESSS" can appear in the lines containing email content and on multiple lines, so it should be checked if it is present and then removed from any line it appears on (that is what I did at least)
NuMBer WoRds ChaNGed (number)

"Finished Attacking This Sample, Please Proceed" should be removed from anyline because this was a failed attempt at distinguishing
between each attack (instead in the Analysis, "Original Label" was used to distinguish each email.
