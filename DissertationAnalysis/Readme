These files are mainly for sections 3.2.1, 3.2.2 and 3.3 in the dissertation. The performance metrics in section 3.1 are available 
in the folder preluding this folder called ClassifierPerformance(Section3.1).

BNCfreqlist was used for word frequency comparisons between original and perturbed words. This file has been processed. If you wish to get

The following CSV files were used for Cohen tests in R

LSTMOrigPerturbPairDF (just original and perturbed word cohen tests)
WCNNOrigPerturbPairDF (just original and perturbed word cohen tests)

LSTMWholeEmailCohen  (original and perturbed email cohen tests)
CNNWholeEmailCohen   (original and perturbed email cohen tests)

This file was used to produce the TF-IDF weighted tokens for the exploratory classifcation in section 3.3
