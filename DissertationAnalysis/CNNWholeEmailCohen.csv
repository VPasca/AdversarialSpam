The city is a port on the Atlantic Ocean. Freetown s economy revolves largely around its harbour, which handles the country s main exports. Industries include fish packing, rice milling, petroleum refining, and the manufacture of cigarettes. History Unsourced image removed The area was first settled in 1787 by freed slaves sent from England and Canada as well as Jamaican Maroons and Black American Loyalists. It is said to have previously been a slave market, by British abolitionists, who started the Sierra Leone Company. It was burnt by the local population under King Jimmy in 1790. Led by former slave Thomas Peters, Freetown was founded in 1792 as part of a resettlement plan for former slaves from Nova Scotia, many of whom were born in the colonial United States. It survived being pillaged by the French in 1794 and the indigenous inhabitants revolted in 1800, but the British retook control, beginning expansionism which led to the creation of Sierra Leone. From 1808 to 1874 the city served as the capital of British West Africa. The city expanded rapidly as many freed slaves settled, accompanied by African soldiers who had fought for Britain in the Napoleonic Wars. During World War II, Britain maintained a naval base at Freetown. Descendants of the freed slaves, called Creoles, play a leading role in the city, even though they are a minority of the population. The city was the scene of fierce fighting in the late 1990s. It was captured by ECOWAS troops seeking to restore President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah in 1998, and later it was unsuccessfully attacked by rebels of the Revolutionary United Front.

"251839499 //A boomerang is a simple wooden implement used for various p&nbsp;-&nbsp; //--> A boomerang is a simple wooden implement used for various purposes. It is primarily attributed to Australian Aborigines, but other forms are found amongst peoples of North East Africa, Arizona Native Americans and in India. The oldest boomerang found so far was discovered in a cave in the carpathian mountains in Poland and is believed to be about 20,000 years old. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on its geographic tribal origins and intended function. The most recognizable type is the returning boomerang, a kind of Throwing Stick that, when thrown correctly, travels in a curved path and returns to its point of origin. Other types of boomerang are of the non returning sort, and indeed, some are not thrown at all but are used in hand to hand combat by Aboriginal people. Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons, percussive musical instruments, battle clubs, fire starters, decoys for hunting waterfowl, and as recreational playthings. The smallest boomerang may be less than 10 cm from tip to tip, and the largest over 2 meters in length. Tribal boomerangs may be incised and or painted with designs meaningful to its maker. Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type. History Boomerang like devices, including hunting sticks, have been used all over the world for hunting, religious and recreational activities. Their origin is still not fully clear. Research has shown that ancient tribes in Europe used special throwing axes. Also, in ancient Egypt a special type of stick was exclusively used by the pharaohs for hunting birds. However, the world famous country of the boomerang is Australia, where the Australian Aborigines have used both boomerangs and hunting sticks for many thousands of years. The name of the boomerang comes from the Indigenous Australian Turuwal tribe of Aborigines who lived south of Sydney, Australia. Today, boomerangs are most used as sporting items. There are different types of throwing contests accuracy of return aussie round trick catch maximum time aloft fast catch and endurance See below . The modern sport boomerang often referred to as a boom or rang , is made of Finnish birch plywood, hardwood, plastic or composite materials and comes in many different shapes and colors. Most sport boomerangs typically weigh less than 100 grams, with MTA boomerangs boomerangs used for the maximum time aloft event often under 25 grams. Design A returning boomerang is an airfoil. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, the wings produce lift. Larger boomerangs are used in hunting, thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are used in sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. Because of its rapid spinning, a boomerang flies in a curve rather than a straight line. When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point. Now in more detail Returning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an airfoil, air travels faster over one surface of an airfoil than the other, as the air is accelerated due to the curvature, thus creating lift, along what is roughly a plane which intersects the airfoil at a near right angle along the long axis of the wing. These wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as the forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc. attempt to reach equilibrium, see Boomerang engineer. This is what makes the boomerang return gracefully to the thrower, fluttering to a stop in his hand ... when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang rocket straight up into the air before plunging to its shattered doom ... when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a Frisbee, but rather throw with the long axis of the wings rotating in an almost vertical plane. Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three symmetrical wings in the planform view , whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped very similar to a question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings, help to set up an auto rotation effect to maximize the boomerang s hover time in descending from its highest point in the flight. Prominent boomerang designer builders include Bob Burwell and Tony Butz from Australia, Rusty Harding from the USA, Jerri Leu from Brazil and others. Basic throwing instructions A right handed boomerang circles towards the left, a left handed boomerang circles towards the right. Most sport boomerangs are in the range of 2.5 to about 4 ounces. The range on most of these is between 25 40 yards or meters A right or left handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but the flight direction will depend upon the boomerang, not the thrower. Throwing a boomerang with the wrong handedness requires a throwing motion that will feel awkward to many throwers. Beginners should thus take care to get a boomerang with the correct handedness. Grasp one wing of the boomerang nearly vertically so that the other wing points forward and the flat side is away from you. The other way works also, but this way is usually easier to learn. Holding the tip by just the end between your thumb and one or two fingers, launch the boomerang forward quickly while trying more for spin than for very much force. The boomerang should flatten out on its own and arc around, sometimes coming to rest a little in front of the thrower or behind the thrower, but ideally","251839499 //A boomerang is a simple wooden implement utilized for various p&nbsp;-&nbsp; //--> A boomerang is a simple wooden implement used for various purposes. It is primarily attributed to Australian Aborigines, but other forms are detected among populations among North East Africa, Arizona Native Americans and in India. The longest boomerang found so far was discovered in a cave in the carpathian mountains in Poland and is believed to be about 20.000 years old. Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on its geographic tribal origines and intended function. The most recognisable type is the returning boomerang, a kind of Throwing Stick that, when pelted correctly, trips in a curved path nor returns to its point of origin. Other types of boomerang are of the non returning sort, and indeed, some are not thrown at all but are used in hand to hand combat by Aboriginal people. Boomerangs can be variously used as hunting weapons, percussive musical instruments, battle clubs, fire starters, decoys for hunting waterfowl, and as recreational playthings. The smallest boomerang may be less after 10:00 cm among tip to tip, and the most over 2 meters in length. Tribal boomerangs may be incised and or painted with designs meaningful to its maker. Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type.

"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/washington/08drug.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Congress Seeks Compromise on Generic Drugs By ROBERT PEAR New York Times April 8, 2007 WASHINGTON, April 7 Senior members of Congress from both parties are working feverishly on legislation that could give consumers access to lower-cost copies of biotechnology drugs that now cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. Prospects for the legislation have increased since Democrats took control of Congress this year. Consumer groups, employers and insurers are lobbying for the bill, which they see as a way to hold down health costs. The proposal faces formidable scientific and political obstacles. Brand-name pharmaceutical companies contend that biotechnology products, made from cells and living organisms, are so complex that a copy will never be identical to the original and therefore cannot be certified as safe without testing in humans. Biotech medicines are the fastest-growing category of health spending, with sales of $40 billion last year, up 20 percent from 2005, according to IMS Health, a market research company. More than 400 biotech products are in the pipeline, for more than 100 diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and Alzheimers. Conventional drugs are synthesized by putting atoms together from basic chemicals and are often in pill form. Biotech drugs, also known as biologic products, are typically proteins made by modifying the DNA of bacteria, yeast or mammal cells, and they are often given by injection or infusion. Supporters of the legislation received an unexpected boost when the chief medical officer of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Janet Woodcock, told Congress last month that the agency had the expertise and experience to decide what types of human and laboratory tests were needed to ensure that copies of a biotechnology drug worked as well as the original. Brand-name drug manufacturers have urged Congress to require human trials before allowing the sale of any products billed as comparable or equivalent to biotechnology medicines already on the market. Some level of clinical testing should be required in all cases, said Dr. Susan D. Desmond-Hellmann, president for product development at Genentech. Dr. Jay P. Siegel, a senior scientist at Johnson & Johnson, said: I would never take a biologic that had not been tested in humans. The risks are too high. But Dr. Woodcock said: Where trials are not needed, it is of questionable ethics to repeat them. The use of human subjects for trials that are not needed is not desirable. Many biotech drugs are effective but expensive. Avastin, a cancer treatment made by Genentech, can cost $4,400 to $8,800 a month, with a maximum cost of $55,000 a year for people who qualify for the companys patient assistance program. Cerezyme, a drug made by Genzyme for Gaucher disease, costs $200,000 a year. Enbrel, made by Amgen for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis, costs an average of $16,000 a year. Biotech treatments for multiple sclerosis range in price from $16,000 to $25,000 a year. Many patients are denied access to these important drugs because even the co-payments can reach thousands of dollars a year, said Arney Rosenblat, a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. Consumers save billions of dollars a year by using low-cost generic versions of conventional drugs, which are approved by the government under a 1984 law. One author of the 1984 law, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, is pushing a bill that would authorize the Food and Drug Administration to approve safe, lower-cost versions of biotechnology drugs. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, both Democrats, have introduced an identical bill, with support from several Republicans, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine and David Vitter of Louisiana. The chief lobby for makers of biotech drugs, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, strongly opposes the bill, saying it would endanger patients and kill incentives for research and innovation. But AARP, the lobby for older Americans, has joined the Consumers Union, Aetna, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Caterpillar, General Motors, Kaiser Permanente, and Walgreens and other chain drugstores in a coalition supporting the legislation. The bill reflects the initial negotiating position of the generic drug industry and its allies as Congress begins serious negotiations to reach a compromise. A co-author of the 1984 law, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, predicted that Congress would pass legislation on the issue this year. Mr. Hatch is trying to work out a compromise, more acceptable to brand-name drug makers, in negotiations with Mrs. Clinton and Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming. Mr. Kennedy represents a state with scores of biotech companies and is chairman of the Senate committee with authority over the issue. Mr. Enzi is the senior Republican on that panel. They are seeking a balance like the one struck in the 1984 law, which fostered a booming generic drug industry while protecting the patent rights of brand-name drug makers a crucial incentive for research on new drugs. The manufacture of biotech drugs is more complex and costly than the production of conventional medicines. But economists cite another reason for the high prices: biotech medicines generally face no competition from copycat drugs. When the first generic copy of a conventional drug becomes available, it may cost 15 percent less than the brand-name product. If several competing generic versions are available, the price often falls by 60 percent or more. Prof. Henry G. Grabowski, a health economist at Duke University, said prices would decline less for biotechnology drugs. But Scott McKibbin, an aide to Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, said biotech drugs were so expensive that discounts of just 10 percent to 20 percent would save tens of millions of dollars for the states Medicaid program and the state employees health plan. The debate over biotech drugs is filled with paradoxes. Brand-name drug companies, which have for years criticized the regulation of drug prices in Europe, now point to Europes strict regulation of follow-on biologics as a possible model for the United States. Democrats, who have often criticized the F.D.A. as lax in enforcing drug safety laws, now say they trust the agency to decide whether copies of biotech drugs are safe and effective, without the full range of tests required for new products. -- Mike Palmedo Research Coordinator Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property American University, Washington College of Law 4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016 T - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659 mpalmedo@wcl.american.edu _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health","http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/08/washington/08drug.html?_r=1&oref=slogin Congress Seeks Compromise on Generic Drugs By ROBERT PEAR New York Times April 8, 2007 WASHINGTON, April 7 Senior members of Congress from both parties are working feverishly on legislation that could give consumers access to lower-cost copies of biotechnology drugs that now cost tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars a year.

Many patients are denied access into these important drugs because even the co-payments can reach thousands among dollars a year, said Arney Rosenblat, a spokeswoman for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. shoppers save billions from dollars a year by using low-cost nonproprietary versions of conventional drugs, which are approved by the government under a 1984 law. One author of the 1984 law, Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, is forcing a bill that would authorise the Food and Drug Administration to approve safe, lowest-cost versions of biotechnology drugs. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York, both Democrats, have introduced an identical bill, with support from several Republicans, including Senators Susan Collins of Maine and David Vitter of Louisiana. The chief lobby per makers of biotech drugs, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, strongly opposes the bill, saying it would endanger patients and kill incentives for research and innovation. But AARP, the lobby for older Americans, has joined the Consumers Union, Aetna, the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association, Caterpillar, General Motors, Kaiser Permanente, and Walgreens and other chain pharmacies in a coalition supporting the legislation. The bill reflects the preliminary negotiating position of the generic drug industry and its allies as Congress begins serious conversations to reach a compromise. A co-author of the 1984 law, Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, predicted that Congress would convey legislation during the issue this year. Mr. Hatch is endeavouring to work out a compromise, more tolerable to name-brand drug makers, onto negotiations with Mrs. Clinton and Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Michael B. Enzi, Republican of Wyoming. Mr. Kennedy represents a country with scores among biotech businesses and is chairman of the Senate committee with authority over the issue. Mr. Enzi is the senior Republican onto that panel. They are seeking a balance like the one struck in the 1984 law, which fostered a burgeoning generic drug industry while protecting the patent droits among brand-name medication setters another crucial incentive towards research on new drugs. The manufacture of biotech medications is more complex and costly than the production of conventional medicines. But forecasters cite another reason for the high prices: biotech medications commonly face no competition from copycat drugs. When the first generic copy of a conventional drug becomes available, it may cost 15 percent less than the brand-name product. unless several competing generic versions are available, the price often falls through 6000 percent or more. Prof. Henry G. Grabowski, another heath economist during Duke University, told prices 'd decline less for biotechnology drugs. But Scott McKibbin, an aide into Gov. Rod R. Blagojevich of Illinois, said biotech drugs were so expensive that discounts of just 10 percent to 20 percent would save tens from milliards among dollars for the states Medicaid program and the state employees health plan. The debate throughout biotech medications is fulfilled from paradoxes. Brand-name drug companies, which have for years criticized the regulation of drug fares in Europe, now point to Europes strict regulation of follow-up biologics as a possible model for the United States. Democrats, who have often criticized the F.D.A. as lax in enforcing medication integrity laws, here say they trust the agency into decide whether copies of biotech medications 're safe and effective, without the full range of ordeals required for new products. ; Mike Palmedo Research Coordinator Program on Information Justice and Intellectual Property American University, Washington College of Law 4910 Massachutsetts Ave., NW Washington, DC 20016 T - 202-274-4442 | F 202-274-0659 mpalmedo@wcl.american.edu _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health",Ham,Yes,5940,6141,121.22448979591837,130.6595744680851,5.520446096654275,5.7072490706319705,1727,1796,35.244897959183675,38.212765957446805,1.6050185873605949,1.6691449814126393,63.19702602230484,59.94423791821561,20.260223048327138,21.74721189591078,10.130111524163569,10.780669144981413,5.947955390334572,7.063197026022305,0.09579127743601426,0.07408808158808157,0.37564441406546656,0.37654664404664395,50.16,40.38,42.90099769762087,41.74980813507291,117.05199919491159,141.03657161980902,29.930928626247123,28.472755180353033,8.591331269349846,8.513931888544892,2.708978328173375,2.708978328173375,38.69969040247678,38.85448916408669,1.0061919504643964,1.0061919504643964,6.96594427244582,6.96594427244582,8.591331269349846,8.513931888544892,12.925696594427244,13.080495356037153,8.746130030959751,8.591331269349846,3.3281733746130033,3.3281733746130033,5.572755417956656,5.572755417956656,0.0,0.0

"I've been updating debian regularly to stay ahead of security problems. Earlier I had figured out that putting an entry like: http://url /url-name would make a directory of url-name under the date directory and put podcasts inside the url-name directory. Well until a couple days ago that was working well. By now, subscription entries that had been working perfectly well before show up as downloads but this time the podcasts themselves are being saved as single files with the names chosen as url-name before. For this to have happened, probably some pretty considerable changes were done recently in python recently since podracer hasn't had an update for debian lately. _______________________________________________ Speakup mailing list Speakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup","I've been updating debian regularly to stay ahead of security problems.

By now, subscription entries that had been working abundantly well before show up as downloads but these time the podcasts yourself 're continuing rescued as mere files with the names chosen since url-name before. per this to have happened, probably some pretty enormous changes became completed freshly in python lately since podracer hasn't got an upgrade for debian lately. _______________________________________________ Speakup mailing list Speakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup",Ham,No,706,717,100.85714285714286,102.42857142857143,6.139130434782609,6.234782608695652,190,189,27.142857142857142,27.0,1.6521739130434783,1.6434782608695653,58.26086956521739,57.391304347826086,26.956521739130434,28.695652173913043,7.82608695652174,7.82608695652174,6.086956521739131,5.217391304347826,0.10873015873015873,0.005555555555555548,0.4823565323565323,0.6252136752136751,39.87,34.09,40.0,37.2972972972973,97.92613071895427,118.37009225092248,26.486486486486488,22.162162162162165,8.108108108108109,9.18918918918919,8.64864864864865,8.64864864864865,46.48648648648649,46.48648648648649,1.6216216216216217,1.6216216216216217,1.6216216216216217,1.6216216216216217,7.027027027027027,7.027027027027027,7.027027027027027,6.486486486486487,1.6216216216216217,1.6216216216216217,7.027027027027027,6.486486486486487,4.324324324324325,4.324324324324325,0.0,0.0

R. R. Tolkien s legendarium, Arda is the name given to the Earth in a period of fictional prehistory, wherein the places mentioned in [[The Lord of the Rings]] and related material once existed. It included several seas and oceans, and the continents of Middle earth, the Dark Lands, and Aman, as well as the island of N menor and other lands, left largely unnamed by Tolkien. Overview Arda was part of E , the universe of all which exists. Arda was created, together with the rest of E , through the Music of the Ainur for the Children of Il vatar that is, Elves and Men . Because the Sun, Moon, stars, and other objects orbited the planet in the cosmology of Middle earth they were considered part of Arda, leading to Arda sometimes being called the Solar System of Middle earth. The term for the Earth itself, excluding these celestial bodies, was Ambar or Imbar . Originally the Earth Arda was flat, the continents were surrounded by a mighty ocean or perhaps by space , Ekkaia or Vaiya, the Encircling Sea, and separated by Belegaer, called the Great Sea and the Sundering Seas. In the First Age, the area in the northwest of Middle earth was occupied by the country of Beleriand, but this was destroyed during the War of Wrath. There was also a separate continent south and east of Middle earth called the Dark Land. Another separate continent to the east of Middle earth was the relatively small Land of the Sun, so called because when the world was flat the Gates of the Sun were near there, and it would be scorched. Information regarding both was vague. To the south were the Hither Lands including Harad, though Harad means South and while properly used for the region immediately south of Gondor and Mordor was often loosely used to refer to every land to the south. There were many stretches of sun scorched desert in Near Harad, but there was supposedly a jungle beyond it which few had ever ventured to, from which the great Oliphaunts were found. Men of Far Harad are also described as being black skinned. The vast lands East were collectively referred to as Rh n, though this may have only referred to those immediately east of the Sea of Rh n and River Running. The Easterlings, like the Haradrim, were a diverse collection of many races. There was even less knowledge of the extreme eastern end of Middle earth, where the land was supposed to stop at another sea. It is known that in ancient times the great chain of the Red Mountains ran north to south near here, and was roughly analogous to the Blue Mountains of the west the world was once symmetrical at the dawn of time . The race of Elves first originated near here, though their original home of Cuivi nen no longer existed by the Third Age. It is not known if the Red Mountains survived into the Third Age, either intact or in some reduced form like the Blue Mountains . It is said that the Blue Wizards went far into the east of Rh n and beyond to stir up rebellions against Sauron in the lands he held sway over, though the tales of these struggles never reached the west in detail. It is also said that the Blue Wizards may have failed in their mission this is interpreted several ways, either that like Saruman they set themselves up as lords of men, or that like Radagast they started to care more for the local people they were charged with protecting than Middle earth as a whole and then","251839499 This article is about the fictional setting.

Sam Burcher Social scientist, Alison Katz has left the World Health Organisation (WHO) after 17 years of devoted service, condemning its ?Let us live and let them die? attitude, which sums up the neglect of millions of people over the past three decades, suffering and dying from diseases of poverty, including notably HIV/AIDS [1]. She is the second AIDS researcher to leave within the past 12 months (see On Quitting HIV [2] this series). ?For over twenty years now, the international AIDS community has persisted in a reductionist obsession with individual behaviour and an implicit acceptance of a deeply flawed and essentially racist theory.? Katz writes. She believes that the narrow and totalitarian approach to AIDS by the WHO not only has had negligible effect, but also has betrayed public health principles and perversely forbidden exploration of any alternative perspectives. Like many others, Katz questions the exclusion of a plethora of co-factors known to increase biological susceptibility to infection by all disease agents, including HIV, among which are under- nutrition, poverty, powerlessness, and the basic necessities for a healthy and dignified life. She believes that the WHO has fallen victim to neoliberal globalisation, and by default, to the economic interests of powerful nations and the transnational corporations. In an open letter dated January 2007 [3] addressed to Dr. Margaret Chan, the incoming Director-General of WHO, Katz set out seven key points to steer her focus back to serving the public, including the critical importance of addressing the commercialisation of science, and the close relationship between industry and academia as highlighted in ISIS' Discussion Paper Towards a Convention on Knowledge [4]. The neoliberal approach to health --------------------------------- There is a strong tendency in the neoliberal approach to health ? and particularly in relation to HIV/AIDS, to blame victims, Katz says [5], for their faulty or irresponsible behaviour. Demeaning stereotypes, coupled with flawed analysis, and ineffectual policies do not appear to have contributed to any significant decrease in infection rates in the worst affected regions such as the continent of Africa. Furthermore, the world's first global sex survey published in The Lancet in 2006 found that multiple sex partners were more common in industrialized countries where disease incidence is relatively low [6]. According to Katz, the dominant neoliberal perspective reinforces the structures of hegemony that create poverty and powerlessness which are themselves the root causes of avoidable disease and death. (Poverty eradication must be central to change and the narrow focus to the problem is being challenged by women in Africa (see Women Confront Aids in Africa SIS 34 [7]). Eileen Stillwaggon, an associate Professor of Economics at Gettysburg College USA, says that [8] the ecology of poverty must be understood, as populations that lack access to medical care and are already coping with parasitic and multiple other infections, are more vulnerable to other diseases, regardless of how they are transmitted. In this respect, HIV/AIDS is no exception. The public health principle, neatly summarized by Pasteur as ?the bacteria is nothing; the terrain is all?, applies to all the diseases of poverty. The focus on individual sexual behaviour is itself highly stigmatising - in addition to being unscientific. On an optimistic note, Stillwaggon observes that solutions to the problems caused by almost all the co-factors exist, and institutions, like the WHO are well placed to advocate for them among vulnerable populations. ISIS has proposed many affordable and patent-free alternative treatments to the disease and its' co-factors in Unraveling AIDS [9]). In order to neutralise the entrenched neoliberal bias within international agencies Katz believes that the WHO must return to its founding principles and advocate for attention to root causes ? the social and economic determinants of health and disease. In today's world, this implies denouncing unfair rules of trade and commerce, the exploitation of national resources, and ruthless liberalization foisted on developing countries, all of which have been shown to have devastating effects on the health of populations. Furthermore, the WHO must take the lead in providing scientific research with independent scientists free of vested interests. To achieve its mandate of ?Health For All?, the WHO must support serious science based on sound evidence. Millions of people's lives are at stake. Political prejudice within the WHO ---------------------------------- Katz worked for 12 years in the division of WHO dealing with family, community, sexual and reproductive health, and 8 years in the HIV/AIDS department. In 1999 she responded to an Internet discussion posting from the perspective of biological vulnerability to HIV infection and racist assumptions underlying current policies and strategies. Her supervisor, on instructions from the executive director, immediately censored her by sending an email instructing that she must not debate this issue. At the same time she received a request from the editor of the African Journal of Aids Research to write up her ideas in an article [1]. Shortly after that, she was isolated from all technical work within her department for 18 months. Following her isolation, Katz's contract was not renewed, so she submitted an internal legal appeal against the WHO for reinstatement and for a proper contract after serving 11 years on 37 temporary contracts. She won the appeal on condition that she leave the HIV/AIDS department. As a working mum supporting three children, she had no choice but to accept the Director General's offer. Efforts on Katz's part to discuss alternative approaches with the WHO HIV/AIDS programme director and the UNAIDS executive director have consistently been declined, even after the publication of the Lancet series, mentioned above, which supports the perspective she is advocating. Independence of international civil servants to fulfil WHO's mandate ------------------------------------------------------------ Katz's concerns expanded to the question of independence of international civil servants, which is seriously undermined by neoliberal influence exerted through powerful member states, private sources and extra-budgetary funding. Pressures at this level have resulted in a repressive, authoritarian and hierarchical management style, which discourages free debate. Katz joined the staff association to fight for proper contracts for all long term ?temporary staff? - some 55 percent of the workforce. The success of this action was limited. A very small proportion of ?false temps? were regularized into proper contracts and then through a major, costly ?restructuring? exercise, many of these long serving staff then lost their jobs, often to inappropriately qualified appointees with better connections. These struggles took place against what she describes as a background of nepotism, cronyism, corruption, harassment, financial mismanagement and chaotic, highly discretionary, human resources management [5]. Furthermore there is an under representation of Africans, Asians, Latin Americans, or Eastern Europeans within staff departments. The predominant influence of the UK, USA and Canada, as well as Australia, and New Zealand; whose representatives are invariably white, male, Anglo-Saxon Protestants linked by powerful networks prevails. WHO's first strike and out -------------------------- Together with a small group in the staff association, Katz organized a one hour work stoppage, the first industrial action in WHO's history, in which 700 staff participated. Her post was abolished three weeks after the work stoppage and three weeks before the normal renewal of her 2-year contract. Swiss unions and staff association lawyers qualify this as interference in the right of association; the WHO administration qualifies it as a ?coincidence?. Katz believes that the WHO must respect international labour standards, including negotiation status for the staff association, in line with ILO (International Labour Organisation) covenants; to provide workers with formal power, adequate funding, and strong links to a bona fide UN umbrella union. WHO staff should be held accountable to WHO's 1978 constitutional mandate, to the Alma Ata principles underlying Health for All, and to the UN Charter and should fully understand the duties and responsibilities of public service. WHO's challenge to achieve Health for All ----------------------------------------- Katz calls for a return to a basic needs and rights-based approach to health [1] in order to provide a sustainable and meaningful response to AIDS that is simultaneously a response to all the diseases of poverty. An alternative political strategy for AIDS and its co-factors would embrace macroeconomic reforms for a fair, rational and sustainable international economic order so that democratically elected governments may reasonably meet people's basic needs, including health, without external interference. In her open letter [3], Katz urges WHO's newly elected Director General, Dr Chan, to address the following major issues in order to fulfil her vision. A focus on inequality rather than poverty; holding meetings and consulting with the poor rather then the rich; a solid, equitable tax base, nationally and internationally, rather than public-private partnerships; knowledge for the public good rather than corporate ?science?; respect for ethical values and an appropriate balance between loyalty to WHO's constitutional mandate and loyalty to current governments of powerful member states and current office holders.

An alternative political estrategia for AIDS and its co-factors would embrace macroeconomic reformations for a fair, rational and sustainable international economic order so that democratically opted governments may reasonably meet people's basic needs, including health, without external interference. into her open letter [3], Katz incites WHO's newly elected Director General, Dr Chan, to address the following large issues in order to fulfil her vision. A focus on inequality rather than poverty; holding meetings nor consulting with the poor rather then the rich; a solid, equitable tax base, nationally and internationally, rather than public-private partnerships; knowledge for the public good rather than corporate ?science?; respect for ethical securities nor an appropriate balance between loyalty to WHO's constitutional mandate and devotion to current governments among powerful member states and current office holders.

An automobile is a wheeled vehicle that carries its own motor. Different types of automobiles include cars, buses, trucks, vans, and motorcycles, with cars being the most popular. The term is derived from Greek 'autos' (self) and Latin 'movre' (move), referring to the fact that it 'moves by itself'. Earlier terms for automobile include 'horseless carriage' and 'motor car'. An automobile has seats for the driver and, almost without exception, one or more passengers. It is the main source of transportation across the world. As of 2005 there are 500 million cars worldwide (0.074 per capita), of which 220 million are located in the United States (0.75 per capita). History The history of automobiles The modern automobile powered by the Otto gasoline engine was invented in Germany by Karl Benz. Even though Karl Benz is credited with the invention of the modern automobile, several other German engineers worked on building the first automobile at the same time. These inventors are: Karl Benz on July 3, 1886 in Mannheim, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach in Stuttgart (also inventors of the first motor bike) and in 1888/89 German-Austrian inventor Siegfried Marcus in Vienna, although Marcus didn't go beyond the prototype stage. Steam powered vehicles Steam-powered self-propelled cars were devised in the late 18th century. The first self-propelled car was built by Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot in 1769, it could attain speeds of up to 6 km/h. In 1771 he designed another steam-driven car, which ran so fast that it rammed into a wall, producing the worlds first car accident. The Internal Combustion Engine In 1806 Fransois Isaac de Rivaz, a Swiss, designed the first internal combustion engine (sometimes abbreviated ""ICE"" today). He subsequently used it to develop the worlds first vehicle to run on such an engine, one that used a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen to generate energy. It was not very successful, as was the case with the British inventor, Brown, and the American inventor, Morey, who produced clumsy IC-engine-powered vehicles about 1826. Etienne Lenoir produced the first successful internal-combustion engine in 1860, and within a few years, about 400 were in operation in Paris. In about 1863, Lenoir installed his engine in a vehicle. It seems to have been powered by city lighting-gas in bottles, and was said by Lenoir to have ""travelled slower than a man could walk, with breakdowns being frequent."" Lenoir, in his patent of 1860, included the provision of a carburettor, so liquid fuel could be substituted for gas, particularly for mobile purposes, i.e., vehicles. Lenoir is said to have tested liquid fuel, such as alcohol, in his stationary engines; but it doesn't appear he used them in his vehicle. If he did, he most certainly didn't use gasoline, as this was not well-known and was considered a waste product. The next innovation comes in the 1860s, with Siegfried Marcus, a German working in Vienna, Austria. He developed the idea of using gasoline as a fuel in a two-stroke internal-combustion engine. In 1870, he built a crude vehicle, with no seats, steering or brakes, but it was spectacular for one reason: it was the world's first internal-combustion-engine-powered vehicle fueled by gasoline. It was tested in Vienna in September of 1870. In 1888/1889, he built a second car, this one with seats, brakes and steering, and a four-stroke engine of his own design. The four-stroke engine had already been written down and patented in 1862 by the Frenchman Beau de Rochas in a long-winded and rambling pamphlet. He printed about 300 copies of his pamphlet and they were distributed in Paris, but nothing came of this, with the patent expiring soon after and the pamphlet disappearing into total obscurity. In fact, hardly anyone knew of it to begin with. Beau de Rochas never built a single engine. Most historians agree that Nikolaus Otto of Germany built the world's first four-stroke engine. He knew nothing of Beau de Rochas's patent or idea, and came upon the idea entirely on his own; in fact, he began thinking about it in 1861, but abandoned the idea until the mid-1870's. There is some evidence, although not conclusive, that one Christian Reithmann, an Austrian living in Germany, had built a four-stroke engine entirely on his own by 1873. Reithmann had been experimenting with IC-engines as early as 1852. In 1883, Edouard Delamare-Deboutteville and Leon Malandin of France installed an internal-combustion engine powered by a tank of city gas on a tricycle. As they tested the vehicle, the tank hose came loose, resulting in an explosion. In 1884, Delamare-Deboutteville and Malandin built and patented a second vehicle. This one consisted of two four-stroke, liquid-fueled engines mounted to an old four-wheeled horse cart. The patent, and presumably the vehicle, contained many innovations, some of which wouldn't be used for decades. However, during the vehicle's first test, the frame broke apart, the vehicle literally ""shaking itself to pieces,"" in Malandin's own words. No more vehicles were built by the two men, and their venture went completely unnoticed and their patent unexploited. No one else knew of the vehicles and experiments until years later. Also about 1884, an Italian by the name of Murginotti installed an IC engine on a tricycle, but it appears the engine wasn't powerful enough to make the vehicle move. The same year, Enrico Bernardi, another Italian, installed a similar engine on his son's tricycle. Although nothing more than a toy, it is said to have operated somewhat successfully, unlike Murginotti's and Deboutteville's vehicles. But if all of the above experiments hadn't taken place, the development of the automobile wouldn't have been retarded by so much as a moment, since they were unknown experiments that went no further than the testing stage. The internal-combustion-engined car really can be said to have begun with Benz and Daimler in 1886, for their vehicles were successful, they went into series-production, and they inspired others. Benz, after building his first three-wheeled car in 1885, built improved versions in 1886 and 1887, and went into production in 1888 -- the world's first vehicle to do so. Appromixately 25 were built until 1893, when his first four-wheeler was introduced. They were powered with four-stroke engines of his own design. Emile Roger of France, already producing Benz engines under license, now added the Benz car to his line of products. Because France was more open to the automobile in general, more were built and sold in France than by Benz himself in Germany. Daimler built a car in 1886 - a new horse carriage fitted with his new high-speed 4-stroke engine. In 1889, he built two vehicles from scratch, with several innovations. From about 1890-1895 about 30 vehicles were built by Daimler and his innovative assistant, Maybach, either at the Daimler works or in the Hotel Hermann, where they set up shop after having a falling out with their backers. In 1890, Emile Levassor and Armand Peugeot of France began series-producing vehicles with Daimler engines, and so laid the foundation of the motor industry in France. They were inspired by Daimler's Stalhradwagen of 1889, which was exhibited in Paris in 1889. The first American automobile with gasoline-powered internal combustion engines was supposedly designed in 1877 by George Baldwin Selden of Rochester, New York, who applied for a patent on the automobile in 1879. Selden didn't build a single car until 1905, when he was forced to do so due to the lawsuit. Selden received his patent and later sued the Ford Motor Company for infringing his patent. Henry Ford was notoriously against the American patent system, and Selden's case against Ford went all the way to the Supreme Court, who ruled that Ford and everyone else was free to build automobiles without paying royalties to Selden, since automobile technology had improved since Selden's patent, and no one was building those antiquated designs. Meanwhile, notable advances in steam power evolved in Birmingham, England by the Lunar Society. It was here that the term horsepower was first used. It was in Birmingham also that the first British four wheel petrol-driven automobiles were built in 1895 by Frederick William Lanchester who also patented the disc brake in the city. Electric vehicles were produced by a small number of manufacturers. Innovation Ransom E. Olds, the creater of the Assembly line The first automobile patent in the United States was granted to Oliver Evans in 1789; in 1804 Evans demonstrated his first successful self-propelled vehicle, which not only was the first automobile in the US but was also the first amphibious vehicle, as his steam-powered vehicle was able to travel on wheels on land and via a paddle wheel in the water. On 5 November 1895, George B. Selden was granted a United States patent for a two-stroke automobile engine. This patent did more to hinder than encourage development of autos in the USA. A major breakthrough came with the historic drive of Bertha Benz in 1888. Steam, electric, and gasoline powered autos competed for decades, with gasoline internal combustion engines achieving dominance in the 1910s.","251839499&nbsp;-&nbsp; //--> If doyou received this message in error or to cancel your subscription, please follow this link.Send postal mail to: 1202 Lexington Avenue, Suite 214, New York, NY 10025 Automobile From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia A small variety of cars, the most popular kind of automobile.

The taste of the flesh has been described as nutty and sweet. Species For the complete list of known species of Durio, see [[List of Durio species]]. Durian trees are relatively large, growing up to 25 ndash 50 nbsp metres 80 ndash 165 ft in height, depending on species. The leaves are evergreen, opposite, elliptic to oblong and 10 ndash 18 nbsp centimetres 4 ndash 7 in long. The flowers are produced in three to thirty clusters together on large branches and the trunk, each flower having a calyx sepals and 5 rarely 4 or 6 petals. Durian trees have one or two flowering and fruiting periods each year, although the timing of these varies depending on species, cultivars and localities. A typical durian tree can bear fruit after four or five years. The durian fruit, which can hang from any branch, matures in about three months after pollination. Among the thirty known species of Durio, so far nine species have been identified to produce edible fruits D. zibethinus, D. dulcis, D. grandiflorus, D. graveolens, [[Durio kutejensis/D. kutejensis]], D. lowianus, D. macrantha, D. oxleyanus and D. testudinarum. However, there are many species for which the fruit has never been collected or properly examined, and other species with edible fruit may exist. ref name Brown ref D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated on a large scale and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets being so fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet. ref ref Durian flowers are large and feathery with copious nectar, and give off a heavy, sour and buttery odour. These features are typical of flowers which are pollinated by certain species of bats while they eat nectar and pollen. ref ref According to a research conducted in Malaysia during 1970s, durians were pollinated almost exclusively by cave fruit bats [[Eonycteris/Eonycteris spelaea]] . ref name Brown However, a more recent research done in 1996 indicated that two species, D. grandiflorus and D. oblongus, were pollinated by spiderhunters Nectariniidae and that the other species, D. kutejensis, was pollinated by giant honey bees and birds as well as bats. ref ref Cultivars Numerous cultivars also called clones of durian have arisen in southeastern Asia over the centuries. They used to be grown from seeds with superior quality, but are now propagated by layering, marcotting, or more commonly, by grafting, including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U grafting onto seedlings of random rootstocks. Different cultivars can be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines. ref name Brown Durian consumers do express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market. ref ref Most cultivars have both a common name and also a code number starting with D . For example, some popular clones are Kop D99 , Chanee D123 , Tuan Mek Hijau D145 , Kan Yao D158 , Mon Thong D159 , Kradum Thong, and with no common name, D24. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of D. zibethinus exist in Thailand, Chanee being the most preferred rootstock due to its resistance to infection by [[Phytophthora palmivora]]. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, though, only four see large scale commercial cultivation Chanee, Kradum Thong, Mon Thong, and Kan Yao.

"Abbott's Blackmail against Thailand Continues - Lives Hang in the Balance Professor Brook K. Baker, Health GAP April 12, 2007 Abbott Laboratories has attempted to temporarily regain lost ground in its ongoing compulsory license dispute with Thailand by granting a further price concession on Kaletra/Aluvia for forty-five low- and lower-middle countries, including, in principle, Thailand. The new price, $1000 per patient per year, is still twice Abbott's no-profit price to least developed and African countries, but it is $1200 less than the ""discount"" price Abbott offered under activist pressure last year on August 13 during the International AIDS Conference in Toronto. At the same that time Abbott promises a price discount, it has announced plans to register Kaletra/Aluvia broadly, though it has not done much in this regard so far. However, the price discount and registration promise are doubly illusory in Thailand because Abbott has withdrawn its registration application for Aluvia, the new heat-stable, Meltrex form of Kaletra that is vastly superior in tropical countries like Thailand. Not content with withdrawing one key AIDS medicine that could adversely affect treatment options for 8,000-20,000 patients in the next year alone, Abbott has also withdrawn six other registration packets and threatened to withhold all new medicines from the Thai market. Abbott has initiated this new-product boycott of Thailand in retaliation for Thailand's lawful issuance of a compulsory license for public, non-commercial use of Kaletra/Aluvia calling this a ""failure to honor intellectual property rights."" Contrary to Abbott's claim, compulsory licensing is an essential part of the intellectual property regime having been recognized in national laws for over a century, having been used on thousands of occasions by the U.S. alone, and having been expressly ratified in the WTO TRIPS Agreement and the Doha Declaration of 2001. As part of its long-term strategy, Abbott is attempting to realize three goals simultaneously. First, in concert with the entire industry and with the assistance of the United States Trade Representative, Abbott is attempting to enshrine even higher standards of intellectual property protection in an escalating series of ""free"" trade agreements. These monopoly-enhancing agreements extend patent terms beyond 20 years, extend patent rights to new uses of existing products, delay registration of generic equivalents through data exclusivity rule and patent/registration linkage rules that prevent drug regulatory authorities from relying on or referring to safety and efficacy data submitted by the data holder, restrict compulsory licensing and parallel importation rights, and revoke price control mechanisms like reference pricing and therapeutic-value formularies. Although U.S./Thai negotiations were suspended last year, partially over access-to-medicines issues, a leaked version of the U.S. proposal exposed the U.S/Pharma effort to treat a very TRIPS-plus patent and data regime in Thailand. Second, Abbott is trying to discover the price discount that will reduce pressure from developing countries, AIDS activists, and multilateral institutions like the WHO and Clinton Foundation. Rest assured that Abbott has attempted to extract premium prices from low- and lower-middle income countries in the past, charging between $3000 and $5000 per year as recently as last August. But the AIDS crisis and widespread poverty in middle-income countries confound Abbott's effort to extract thousands of dollars of profit from each AIDS patient each year, and thus Abbott has had to respond with a series of face-saving price cuts designed to relieve its public relations nightmare. As part of this strategy, Abbott is trying undercut the entry price of generic manufacturers that have not yet reached efficient economies-of-scale. Abbott's effort to buy off the bigger middle-income markets in Brazil and Thailand is predictably undermining incentives for generic entry. Third, Abbott is trying to punish Thailand severely for using a fully TRIPS-compliant flexibility for accessing cheaper medicines. Its product boycott represents a new low in Pharma's perverse pursuit of unassailable monopoly protections. By intimidating Thailand, like it did Brazil two years ago, Abbott hopes to dissuade other developing countries from following Thailand's lead. Big Pharma would like to draw a boundary around Africa and around AIDS drugs and declare a regional and disease-specific cease fire in its ongoing Pharma Wars. But, by the same token, Big Pharma would like to eliminate utilization of TRIPS flexibilities and disincentivize the development of a robust generic industry that would compete with regard to newer, more broadly patented medicines. The price cuts offered by Abbott are insufficient to meet the long-term needs of Thailand and other developing countries. As can be seen, price cuts are conditioned on disavowal of key TRIPS-compliant flexibilities. Although the price discounts might temporarily beat start-up generic prices, the eventual prices of multiple generic producers manufacturing at efficient economies-of-scale will always beat the price of higher-cost Western manufacturers. Likewise, relying on single-source suppliers unavoidably raises the risk of stock-outs and product interruptions. Finally, developing countries have their own national and regional interest in promoting local manufacturing capacity. Although gaining a better price from Abbott is an important short-run victory, Thailand should not relinquish its compulsory license on Kaletra/Aluvia or other medicines. The license can always be held in abeyance for use when generic prices drop further and when the generic versions of Aluvia are WHO-prequalified and registered in Thailand. Moreover, Thailand and other developing countries should continue to pressure Abbott for voluntary access licenses, given to patent pools or to multiple producers, so that generic pharmaceutical companies can begin to manufacture and register more cost efficient forms of this very important AIDS medicine. In fact, Thailand and other countries should go even further and grant compulsory licenses on ritonavir as a separate product so that it can be co-formulated with other protease inhibitors that might be superior to lopinavir. Abbott's crude and unlawful boycott of Thailand cannot be made palatable by a unilaterally granted and unilaterally revocable price discount. The stakes of this boycott are death. It's hard to understand why a company that makes $1.1 billion a year from Kaletra sales is willing to kill people to secure more profits. Hopefully this question will be asked at the Abbott shareholder meeting in Chicago on April 27. Professor Brook K. Baker, Health GAP Northeastern U.

Although U.S./Thai negotiations were suspended last year, partially over access-to-medicines issues, another sneaked version of the U.S. proposition subjected the U.S/Pharma effort to treat a very TRIPS-plus patent and statistics regime in Thailand. Second, Abbott is trying to discover the price discount that will reduce pressure from developing countries, AIDS activists, and multilateral institutions like the WHO and Clinton Foundation. Rest assured that Abbott has attempted to extract premium fares from low- and lower-middle income countries in the past, charging between $3000 and $5000 per year as recently as last August. But the AIDS crisis and widespread poverty in medium-income countries confound Abbott's effort to extract thousands of bucks from beneficiary from each AIDS patient each year, and thus Abbott has had to respond with a series of face-saving price cutbacks conceived to relieve its governmental relaciones nightmare. As part of this strategy, Abbott is trying undermined the entry price from generic manufacturers that have not yet arrived efficient economies-of-scale. Abbott's effort to buy off the larger middle-income mercados at Brazil and Thailand is predictably undermining incentives per generic entry. Third, Abbott is trying to punish Thailand severely for using another altogether TRIPS-compliant flexibility into accessing cheaper medicines. Its product boycott represents a new low in Pharma's perverse pursuit of unassailable monopoly protections. By intimidating Thailand, like it did Brazil two centuries ago, Abbott hopes to dissuade other developing economies from following Thailand's lead. Big Pharma would like to draw a boundary around Africa and throughout AIDS medications and proclaim a gional and disease-specific cease fire in its ongoing Pharma Wars. But, by the same token, Big Pharma would like to eliminate utilization of TRIPS relaxations and disincentivize the development of a robust generic industry that would compete with regard to newer, stronger broadly patented medicines. The price cuts offered by Abbott are insufficient to meet the long-term needs of Thailand and other developing countries. As can be seen, price cuts are acclimatized on disavowal of key TRIPS-compliant flexibilities. Although the price discounts might temporarily beat start-up generic prices, the eventual prices of multiple generic producers manufacturing at efficient economies-of-scale will always beat the price of higher-cost Western manufacturers. Likewise, relying on single-source suppliers unavoidably raises the risk of stock-outs nor product interruptions. Finally, developing countries have their own national and regional interest in promoting local manufacturing capacity. Although gaining a better price from Abbott is an important short-run victory, Thailand should not relinquish its compulsory license on Kaletra/Aluvia or other medicines. The license can always be held in abeyance for use when generic prices decline further and when the generic versions of Aluvia are WHO-prequalified and registered in Thailand. Moreover, Thailand and other developing countries should continue to pressure Abbott for voluntary accessibility licenses, given to patent pools or to multiple producers, so that nonproprietary pharmaceutical businesses can begin to manufacture and register more cost efficient forms of this very important AIDS medicine. In fact, Thailand and other economies should go even further and grant obligatory authorizations towards ritonavir as a separate product so that it can be co-formulated among other protease blockers that might be superior to lopinavir. Abbott's crude and unlawful boycott of Thailand cannot be made palatable by a unilaterally afforded and unilaterally revocable price discount. The stakes among this boycott are death. It's hard to understand why a company that makes $1.1 billion a year from Kaletra sales becomes willing to kill people to secure more profits. Hopefully this question will be asked at the Abbott shareholder meeting in Chicago on April 27. Professor Brook K. Baker, Health GAP Northeastern U.

"So far (eep!), the documentation talks about file test operators as working with pairs, which will be a weird thing to explain, I guess. I'm wondering if this matters to the mere user at all, and if we should even talk about them in terms of ""pairs"". I don't want a different set of terms in the docs and Llama6. Even if the current Pugs is different than what the final answer will be, as long as I know the final answer I'll be fine. :) For a directory that exists, using the adverbial form or the fat arrow form work for true or false things: pugs> 'doc' ~~ :d ""doc"" pugs> ""doc"" ~~ d => 1 ""doc"" pugs> ""doc"" ~~ d => 0 Bool::False The fat arrow doesn't seem to work as I expected with :s though. I figured that the value of the pair would be the thing to match the answer of the test.

Browne s writings display a deep curiosity towards the natural world, influenced by the Scientific revolution of Baconian enquiry. In counterbalance his Christian faith exuded tolerance and goodwill towards humanity in an often intolerant era. A consummate literary craftsman, Browne s works are permeated by frequent reference to Classical and Biblical sources and to his own highly idiosyncratic personality. His literary style varies according to genre resulting in a rich, unusual prose that ranges from rough note book observations to the highest baroque eloquence. Biography The son of a silk merchant from Upton, Cheshire, he was born in the parish of St Michael, Cheapside, in London on October 19, 1605. His father died while he was still young and he was sent to school at Winchester College. In 1623 Browne went up to Oxford University. He graduated from Pembroke College, Oxford in 1626 after which he studied medicine at various Continental universities, including Leiden, where he received an MD in 1633. He settled in Norwich in 1637 where he practiced medicine and lived until his death in 1682. His first well known work bore the Latin title [[Religio Medici]] The Religion of a Physician . This work was circulated in manuscript among his friends, and it caused Browne some surprise and embarrassment when an unauthorised edition appeared in 1642, since the work contained a number of religious speculations that might be considered unorthodox. An authorised text with some of the controversial matter removed appeared in 1643. The expurgation did not end the controversy in 1645, Alexander Ross attacked Religio Medici in his Medicus Medicatus The Doctor, Doctored and in fact the book was placed upon the Papal index of forbidden reading for Catholics in the same year. In 1646, Browne published [[Pseudodoxia Epidemica]], or, Enquiries into Very many Received Tenets, and commonly Presumed Truths, whose title refers to the prevalence of false beliefs and vulgar errors. A sceptical work that debunks a number of legends circulating at the time in a paradoxical and witty manner, it displays the Baconian side of Browne mdash the side that was unafraid of what at the time was still called the new learning. The book is significant in the history of science. In 1658 Browne published together two Discourses which are intimately related to each other, the first [[Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial]] or a Brief Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk, occasioned by the discovery of some Bronze Age burials in earthenware vessels found in Norfolk. These inspired Browne to meditate upon the funerary customs of the world and the fleetingness of earthly fame and reputation. Urn Burial s twin Discourse is [[The Garden of Cyrus]], or, The Quincunciall Lozenge, or Network Plantations of the Ancients, Artificially, Naturally, and Mystically Considered, whose slight subject is the quincunx, the arrangement of five units like the five spot in dice, which Browne uses to demonstrate that the Platonic forms exist throughout Nature. center center 1671 Knighthood to death In 1671 King Charles II, accompanied by the Royal Court, visited Norwich. The courtier John Evelyn, who had occasionally corresponded with Browne, took good use of the Royal visit to call upon the learned doctor of European fame and wrote of his visit His whole house garden is a paradise and Cabinet of rarieties that of the best collection, amongst Medails, books, Plants, natural things.

"Here's the original post where I gave the rationale for making the flags work as they do: I'm comfortable with a modification saying that :vtable always gets the 'self' parameter like :method does. But without :method, :vtable should not make an entry in the namespace of the class, or call 'add_method' on the class. This results in simpler syntax for the cases where you only want to override the vtable entry. # method name is the same as vtable name .sub get_string :method :vtable # accessible as either $obj.stringify() or vtable .sub stringify :method :vtable('get_string') # accessible only as vtable .sub get_string :vtable # accessible only as vtable, and sub name ignored .sub stringify :vtable('get_string') Allison","Here's the original post where I gave the rationale for making the flags travail as they do: I'm uneasy with another modification telling that :vtable permanently gets the 'self' parameter like :method does.

This accomplishments onto simpler lexical per the cases where you solely want into overstep the vtable entry. # manner appellation becomes the same as vtable name .sub get_string :method :vtable # affordable since either $obj.stringify() or vtable .sub stringify :method :vtable('get_string') # affordable only since vtable .sub get_string :vtable # affordable only as vtable, nor sub name overlooked .sub stringify :vtable('get_string') Allison",Ham,No,612,661,51.0,60.09090909090909,5.275862068965517,5.698275862068965,166,176,13.833333333333334,16.0,1.4310344827586208,1.5172413793103448,67.24137931034483,62.06896551724138,20.689655172413794,22.413793103448278,4.310344827586207,7.758620689655173,4.310344827586207,4.310344827586207,0.2111111111111111,0.09375,0.6444444444444444,0.71875,42.08,33.62,43.83561643835616,39.04109589041096,33.62495949550089,45.10380894584658,32.19178082191781,27.397260273972602,9.58904109589041,8.21917808219178,4.794520547945205,4.794520547945205,21.232876712328768,23.28767123287671,2.73972602739726,2.73972602739726,10.95890410958904,10.95890410958904,9.58904109589041,9.58904109589041,8.21917808219178,9.58904109589041,0.0,0.0,1.36986301369863,1.36986301369863,7.534246575342466,6.8493150684931505,0.0,0.0

"Volker and Ronnie, I've just checked in some very strange code! Have a look at tests/lockwait.c in my bzr ctdb tree. Basically it shows how we can do event driven tdb, with basically zero overhead (at least for the common uncontended case). This solves the problem of how we can handle waiting on a tdb lock in the ctdb daemon. Internally, it uses fork()+lock on the contended path, but its wrapped in a little bit of magic that turns this into a event in our event system, so basically the caller does a non-blocking tdb_chainlock(), then if it blocks they use the lockwait() code to trigger an event when the lock becomes available. When the callback happens the tdb_chainlock() can be retried. What I really like about this is we only pay a price in the contended case, which I expect to be very rare. We also send no extra messages over the unix domain socket. What do you think? Cheers, Tridge","Volker and Ronnie, I've just checked in some very strange code!

"This is a multi-part message in MIME format. -- -- [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ] For your information, please find below and attached a joint letter from the EATG and ATAC for the attention of Miles White of Abbott Laboratories. Best Regards, Wim Vandevelde EATG _____________________________________________________ Miles White Chairman and CEO Abbott Laboratories 100, Abbott Park Road Abbott Park, IL 60064 U.S.A. Brussels / New York, April 18, 2007 *_Subject: Abbott / _**_Thailand_**__* Mr. White: The European AIDS Treatment Group (EATG) and the AIDS Treatment Activists Coalition (ATAC) have witnessed several hostile, unprecedented decisions by Abbott management. The ritonavir price hike in the U.S. in 2003 and the Brazilian price deal in 2005 are two examples of a corporation whose ethical underpinnings were of questionable status. Abbott's recent decision not to file Aluvia or any other new products in Thailand is a clear indication that the company may not possess an ethical compass. Your arrogant and reactionary response to the Thai government's decision to issue a compulsory license for Aluvia is a gross repudiation of corporate responsibility, and a complete lack of regard for the right of a sovereign nation to fend for the health and well being of its people. Have we not all witnessed the tragic and unforgivable repercussions of this approach when applied to foreign policy matters by certain countries? Unless your corporate management structure lacks the competence to comprehend response to its actions, Abbott must have anticipated the international disgust that your decision, unmollified by any recent price reduction structures in other countries, would engender. This is so contrary to the productive meetings that EATG has had with your newly designated HIV/HCV research and advocacy team that we are both nonplused and very angry. What kind of partnership could actually be sustained with any company based on repeated violations of basic decency? A well-established and regarded corporate franchise is well aware of the economic stature and political clout it possesses, and deftly balances corporate and public needs. Recent actions taken by your company suggest that is a description that is no longer applicable to Abbott. The EATG and ATAC applaud Thailand for pursuing a compulsory license for Aluvia. Generic competition, WHO's intervention and activist pressure have compelled your company to now offer a 55% reduction in your tiered pricing for low-and lower-middle income countries. In light of current and often enduring financial barriers to the creation of a sustainable and improving market for your products, it should not have taken such effort to make what any person with average financial acumen would label good corporate sense. So why has your corporation taken punitive and retaliatory actions against the country of Thailand? It is difficult, if not risible to envision Thailand as an adversary of any consequence to Abbott, considering the crude demonstration that you can, indeed, dictate the terms of the marketplace in that country. Despite your announcement of a lower price for Aluvia - a clearly needed drug in Thailand and many other countries - you still withhold seven of your products from the Thai market. This is nothing more than brutal sadism masquerading as a corporate strategy to protect profit margins. The world is well aware of the demands and pressures for corporations to pursue profits. Even shortsighted, near-term profit making is considered an acceptable business practice in some sectors. Yet, a special, enduring level of revulsion is reserved for those corporations whose indecent and brutal decisions clearly endanger the health and survival of other human beings. The Abbott slogan states ""a promise for life"". The repercussions of your actions in Thailand betray this corporate identifier as cynical propaganda. Some shareholders may have short memories and greedy pockets, but serious investors aware of the full spectrum of indices that determine a company's health and investment prospects, as well as patients in need of life-saving medicines, are unlikely to be impressed. We are most definitely not impressed. We no longer trust you. Trust may be extended once again in the future, but be aware it will be hard earned -- and verified. We must insist, to the benefit of all parties involved, that you immediately take the following actions. The EATG and ATAC must witness the immediate registration of Aluvia and other Abbott products in Thailand. Abbott must publish a comprehensive list of all countries eligible for Aluvia at a cost of $1,000 and $500 per patient per year. This list must also indicate in which countries the new heat-stable formulation is registered and available, and in which countries the registration is still pending or yet to be started. These are exceedingly reasonable requests which pose no threat to the financial health of your corporation. Yet, they offer the opportunity to create a very real sense of gratitude in many sectors. Failure to comply, however, will make it impossible for us to maintain our relations with Abbott at the current level.

They're referencesto to internal data structures, not actual memory locations. Butyou're on the right track. $xml is a scalar that contains a reference to an anonymous hashstructure. In your case, there is only one key/value pair in the hash,""FOREST"". So far, we could write that as: my $xml = { FOREST => ""value""}; If you're not comfortable with references, you should take anotherlook at the perlreftut and perlref man pages. The value of FOREST, in turn, is a reference to an anonymous array ofall the forests. The anonymous array of forests, in turn, contains ananonymous hashref with information on each forest. Something likethis: my $xml = { FOREST => [{} So @{$xml->{FOREST}} says, ""give me the array that is the value of $xml->{FOREST}"". Since@{$xml->{FOREST}}, is a list of hashrefs, though, it's not much use byitself. That's why we cycle through it with the foreach. For eachelement of @{$xml->{FOREST}}, $_->{NAME} is the name of the forest,$_->{TREE} is the reference to the anonymous list of trees, etc. To sort the forests, you'll need to sort based on the value of$_->{NAME}. sort() supports that, since $a and $b are simplyreferences to each of the values of the list being sorted: foreach ( sort { $a->{NAME} cmp $b->{NAME} } @{$xml->{FOREST}} ) { print $_->{NAME}, ""\n""; } see perlfunc for information on sort. If this sounds complicated, it is. Because XML is a markup language,each element of a similar type has the same label. This makes it veryeasy to apply attributes to all elements of a specific type, or counthow many elements of a specific type you have. If you want to dosomething to a particular element, though, you run into trouble. Ifall your forests are just called , it's hard to knowwhich is which. XML::Simple solves this by aggregating allthe elements at a particular level of the XML parse tree intoanonymous array. $xml->{FOREST}->[0] is the first forest,$xml->{FOREST}->[1] the second, etc. Looking at the contents of $xml with Data::Dumper as I suggestedbefore would help make things clearer.

"Jail for obsessive collector who stole museum exhibits ///20th April 2007, 14:15 WST / It was the biggest museum theft in the nation's history, with more than 2,000 specimens, including a skull from the now-extinct Tasmanian tiger, stolen from Sydney's Australian Museum. Former museum pest controller Hendrikus van Leeuwen, convicted of the theft, was today jailed for up to seven years for what a judge described as ""enormous, incalculable harm"". ""Through his selfish actions he has cost the Australian Museum not only a great deal of money, but damaged its reputation,"" District Court Judge Peter Berman said in sentencing Leeuwen. "" ... perhaps most importantly of all, (he has) caused permanent harm to the ability of scientists to study many aspects of the natural history of Australia and the rest of the world."" Van Leeuwen, 50, began collecting bird and animal specimens, including road-kill, as a boy in Holland, the court was told. But his interest became an obsession, costing him his job and, ultimately, his freedom. Soon after he was hired in 1996, van Leeuwen began stealing specimens from the Australian Museum whose natural history collection - the oldest in the country - dates back to 1827. Van Leeuwen was ""not a very good pest controller"", according to one witness. But he was a very successful thief. His haul included skulls, skins and skeletons from animals such as the Ganges River dolphin, the clouded leopard and the rare Bulmer's Fruit Bat. Van Leeuwen was sacked in 2003 after the Independent Commission Against Corruption recovered more than 2,000 specimens in raids at his Londonderry home, in Sydney's west. The 2007 Australian of the Year, scientist and author Tim Flannery, gave evidence, saying he believed it was ""the largest theft of museum holdings every perpetrated in Australia"". Some items were irreparably damaged, the court was told. Some exhibits had their identifying numbers removed while others were bleached or, like the Tasmanian tiger skull, had teeth removed. Judge Berman rejected van Leeuwen's claim that he took the exhibits to protect them, finding he was ""obsessed"" with collecting specimens and simply wanted to possess them. Many of the exhibits - valued at more than $875,000 - were ""unique and irreplaceable"", the judge said. Van Leeuwen pleaded guilty to 15 counts of stealing from his employer, while Judge Berman took another 179 offences into account in sentencing. The charges were representative of more than 2,000 stolen items, the museum said. Australian Museum Trust president Brian Sherman said the impact of the theft on museum staff and the community, and the scale of the losses, was ""incalculable"". ""Such a betrayal of trust is always regrettable, but when such deliberate and discriminating thefts compromise the work of hundreds of researchers conducted over centuries, it is particularly heartbreaking for our loyal staff,"" he said. ""The community is also deprived of the knowledge and experience represented by these specimens."" Van Leeuwen must serve at least five years behind bars and will be eligible for parole in 2012. http://www.thewest.com.au/ ------------------------------ _______________________________________________ MSN-list mailing list MSN-list@te.verweg.com http://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list End of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 96 ***************************************","Jail for obsessive collector whom stole museum displays ///20th April 2007, 14:15 WST / It stood the biggest museum theft in the nation's history, with more than 2,000 specimens, including a skull from the now-extinct Tasmanian tiger, stolen from Sydney's Australian Museum.

To him life was never monotonous or stale. There was always Pisah, the fish, to be caught in the many streams and the little lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one spent upon the ground. Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them, but though they never quite reached him with those cruel, sharp claws of theirs, yet there were times when one could scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his smooth hide. Quick was Sabor, the lioness, and quick were Numa and Sheeta, but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning. With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends. How? Ask not. But this is known to the denizens of the jungle, that on many moonlight nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the elephant, walked together, and where the way was clear Tarzan rode, perched high upon Tantor's mighty back. Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of his parents and the skeleton of Kala's baby. At eighteen he read fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes on the shelves. Also could he write, with printed letters, rapidly and plainly, but script he had not mastered, for though there were several copy books among his treasure, there was so little written English in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this other form of writing, though he could read it, laboriously. Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his native language. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of the interior. High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the fourth. It was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous snakes. Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its frontier. But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book, the ancient security of his jungle was broken forever. At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in single file, over the brow of a low hill. In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slender wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires, and long bows and poisoned arrows. On their backs were oval shields, in their noses huge rings, while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers. Across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of color, and on each breast three concentric circles. Their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance. Following them were several hundred women and children, the former bearing upon their heads great burdens of cooking pots, household utensils and ivory. In the rear were a hundred warriors, similar in all respects to the advance guard. That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than whatever unknown enemies lurked in their advance was evidenced by the formation of the column; and such was the fact, for they were fleeing from the white man's soldiers who had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of his black troops. For many days they had gorged themselves on meat, but eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades. That night the black soldiers of the white man had had meat a-plenty, and this little remnant of a once powerful tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle toward the unknown, and freedom. But that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to many of the wild denizens of their new home. For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally, early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river, which seemed less thickly overgrown than any ground they had yet encountered. Here they set to work to build a new village, and in a month a great clearing had been made, huts and palisades erected, plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had taken up their old life in their new home. Here there were no white men, no soldiers, nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for cruel and thankless taskmasters. Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the territory surrounding their new village. Several had already fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats, and with lions and leopards, the ebony warriors hesitated to trust themselves far from the safety of their palisades. But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga, wandered far into the dense mazes to the west. Warily he stepped, his slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield firmly grasped in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body. At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield many slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the thick, dark, tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick. Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father's village, but still headed westward, and climbing into the fork of a great tree he fashioned a rude platform and curled himself for sleep. Three miles to the west slept the tribe of Kerchak. Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving through the jungle in search of food. Tarzan, as was his custom, prosecuted his search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by the time he reached the beach. The apes scattered by ones, and twos, and threes in all directions, but ever within sound of a signal of alarm. Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east, and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi, when the faintest shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention. For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a strange and fearful creature. It was Kulonga. Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly back along the trail. She did not run; but, after the manner of her kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to escape. Close after her came Kulonga. Here was meat. He could make a killing and feast well this day. On he hurried, his spear poised for the throw. At a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again upon another straight stretch. His spear hand went far back the muscles rolled, lightning-like, beneath the sleek hide. Out shot the arm, and the spear sped toward Kala. A poor cast. It but grazed her side. With a cry of rage and pain the she-ape turned upon her tormentor. In an instant the trees were crashing beneath the weight of her hurrying fellows, swinging rapidly toward the scene of trouble in answer to Kala's scream. As she charged, Kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an arrow with almost unthinkable quickness. Drawing the shaft far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart of the great anthropoid. With a horrid scream Kala plunged forward upon her face before the astonished members of her tribe. Roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward Kulonga, but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a frightened antelope. He knew something of the ferocity of these wild, hairy men, and his one desire was to put as many miles between himself and them as he possibly could. They followed him, racing through the trees, for a long distance, but finally one by one they abandoned the chase and returned to the scene of the tragedy. None of them had ever seen a man before, other than Tarzan, and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of creature it might be that had invaded their jungle. On the far beach by the little cabin Tarzan heard the faint echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the direction of the sound. When he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering about the dead body of his slain mother. Tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded. He roared out his hideous challenge time and again. He beat upon his great chest with his clenched fists, and then he fell upon the body of Kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart. To lose the only creature in all his world who ever had manifested love and affection for him was the greatest tragedy he had ever known. What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape! To Tarzan she had been kind, she had been beautiful. Upon her he had lavished, unknown to himself, all the reverence and respect and love that a normal English boy feels for his own mother. He had never known another, and so to Kala was given, though mutely, all that would have belonged to the fair and lovely Lady Alice had she lived. After the first outburst of grief Tarzan controlled himself, and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed the killing of Kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary could convey. It was enough, however, for his needs. It told him of a strange, hairless, black ape with feathers growing upon its head, who launched death from a slender branch, and then ran, with the fleetness of Bara, the deer, toward the rising sun. Tarzan waited no longer, but leaping into the branches of the trees sped rapidly through the forest. He knew the windings of the elephant trail along which Kala's murderer had flown, and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous detours of the trail. At his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire, and across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope. In an hour he struck the trail again, and coming to earth examined the soil minutely. In the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made, but much larger than his. His heart beat fast. Could it be that he was trailing a MAN--one of his own race? There were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions. So his quarry had already passed on his return along the trail. As he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to the bottom of its shallow depression--ah, the trail was very fresh, his prey must have but scarcely passed. Tarzan swung himself to the trees once more, and with swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail. He had covered barely a mile when he came upon the black warrior standing in a little open space. In his hand was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing arrows. Opposite him across the little clearing stood Horta, the boar, with lowered head and foam flecked tucks, ready to charge. Tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange creature beneath him--so like him in form and yet so different in face and color. His books had portrayed the NEGRO, but how different had been the dull, dead print to this sleek thing of ebony, pulsing with life. As the man stood there with taut drawn bow Tarzan recognized him not so much the NEGRO as the ARCHER of his picture book-- A stands for Archer How wonderful! Tarzan almost betrayed his presence in the deep excitement of his discovery. But things were commencing to happen below him. The sinewy black arm had drawn the shaft far back; Horta, the boar, was charging, and then the black released the little poisoned arrow, and Tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar. Scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere Kulonga had fitted another to it, but Horta, the boar, was upon him so quickly that he had no time to discharge it. With a bound the black leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in Horta's back. Then Kulonga sprang into a near-by tree. Horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more; a dozen steps he took, then he staggered and fell upon his side. For a moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively, then he lay still. Kulonga came down from his tree. With a knife that hung at his side he cut several large pieces from the boar's body, and in the center of the trail he built a fire, cooking and eating as much as he wanted. The rest he left where it had fallen. Tarzan was an interested spectator. His desire to kill burned fiercely in his wild breast, but his desire to learn was even greater. He would follow this savage creature for a while and know from whence he came. He could kill him at his leisure later, when the bow and deadly arrows were laid aside. When Kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond a near turning of the path, Tarzan dropped quietly to the ground. With his knife he severed many strips of meat from Horta's carcass, but he did not cook them. He had seen fire, but only when Ara, the lightning, had destroyed some great tree. That any creature of the jungle could produce the red-and-yellow fangs which devoured wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised Tarzan greatly, and why the black warrior had ruined his delicious repast by plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him. Possibly Ara was a friend with whom the Archer was sharing his food. But, be that as it may, Tarzan would not ruin good meat in any such foolish manner, so he gobbled down a great quantity of the raw flesh, burying the balance of the carcass beside the trail where he could find it upon his return. And then Lord Greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon his naked thighs and took up the trail of Kulonga, the son of Mbonga, the king; while in far-off London another Lord Greystoke, the younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's father, sent back his chops to the club's CHEF because they were underdone, and when he had finished his repast he dipped his finger-ends into a silver bowl of scented water and dried them upon a piece of snowy damask. All day Tarzan followed Kulonga, hovering above him in the trees like some malign spirit. Twice more he saw him hurl his arrows of destruction--once at Dango, the hyena, and again at Manu, the monkey. In each instance the animal died almost instantly, for Kulonga's poison was very fresh and very deadly. Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his quarry. He knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle, who were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with their jungle neighbors, yet as often recovered as not. No, there was something mysterious connected with these tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere scratch. He must look into the matter. That night Kulonga slept in the crotch of a mighty tree and far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes. When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared. The black warrior was furious and frightened, but more frightened than furious. He searched the ground below the tree, and he searched the tree above the ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder. Kulonga was panic-stricken. His spear he had hurled at Kala and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and arrows were gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife. His only hope lay in reaching the village of Mbonga as quickly as his legs would carry him. That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took the trail at a rapid trot. >From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in his wake. Kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch half cut through and left hanging about fifty feet higher up. Thus Tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches. As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed on him until he traveled almost over the black's head. His rope he now held coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for the kill. The moment was delayed only because Tarzan was anxious to ascertain the black warrior's destination, and presently he was rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing, at one end of which lay many strange lairs. Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery. The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred yards of planted fields between the jungle and the village. Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but Tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even room for the shadow of a thought between. So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil of rope sped sinuously above him from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of Mbonga, and ere the king's son had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his neck. So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that Kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe. Hand over hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by his neck in mid-air; then Tarzan climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering verdure of the tree. Here he fastened the rope securely to a stout branch, and then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into Kulonga's heart. Kala was avenged. Tarzan examined the black minutely, for he had never seen any other human being. The knife with its sheath and belt caught his eye; he appropriated them. A copper anklet also took his fancy, and this he transferred to his own leg. He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast. He marveled at the sharp filed teeth. He investigated and appropriated the feathered headdress, and then he prepared to get down to business, for Tarzan of the Apes was hungry, and here was meat; meat of the kill, which jungle ethics permitted him to eat. How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man with the heart and head and body of an English gentleman, and the training of a wild beast? Tublat, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he had killed in a fair fight, and yet never had the thought of eating Tublat's flesh entered his head. It could have been as revolting to him as is cannibalism to us. But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer? Was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger? Suddenly, a strange doubt stayed his hand. Had not his books taught him that he was a man? And was not The Archer a man, also? Did men eat men? Alas, he did not know. Why, then, this hesitancy! Once more he essayed the effort, but a qualm of nausea overwhelmed him. He did not understand. All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black man, and thus hereditary instinct, ages old, usurped the functions of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a worldwide law of whose very existence he was ignorant. Quickly he lowered Kulonga's body to the ground, removed the noose, and took to the trees again.

To him life was never monotonous or stale. There was always Pisah, the fish, to be caught in the many streams and the little lakes, and Sabor, with her ferocious cousins to keep one ever on the alert and give zest to every instant that one spent upon the ground. Often they hunted him, and more often he hunted them, but though they never quite reached him with those cruel, sharp claws of theirs, yet there were times when one could scarce have passed a thick leaf between their talons and his smooth hide. Quick was Sabor, the lioness, and quick were Numa and Sheeta, but Tarzan of the Apes was lightning. With Tantor, the elephant, he made friends. How? Ask not. But this is known to the denizens of the jungle, that on many moonlight nights Tarzan of the Apes and Tantor, the elephant, walked together, and where the way was clear Tarzan rode, perched tertiary upon Tantor's mighty back. Many days during these years he spent in the cabin of his father, where still lay, untouched, the bones of her parents and the skeleton of Kala's baby. At eighteen he read fluently and understood nearly all he read in the many and varied volumes on the shelves. Also could he write, with printed letters, rapidly and plainly, but script he had not mastered, for though there were several copy books among his treasure, there was so little written English in the cabin that he saw no use for bothering with this other form of writing, though he could read it, laboriously. Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his native language. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no greater river to bring down the savage natives of the interior. High hills shut it off on three sides, the ocean on the fourth. It was alive with lions and leopards and poisonous snakes. Its untouched mazes of matted jungle had as yet invited no hardy pioneer from the human beasts beyond its frontier. But as Tarzan of the Apes sat one day in the cabin of his father delving into the mysteries of a new book, the ancient warranty of his jungle was broken forever. At the far eastern confine a strange cavalcade strung, in single file, over the brow of a low hill. In advance were fifty black warriors armed with slim wooden spears with ends hard baked over slow fires, and long bows and poisoned arrows. On their backs were oval shields, in their noses huge rings, while from the kinky wool of their heads protruded tufts of gay feathers. Across their foreheads were tattooed three parallel lines of color, and on each breast three concentric circles. Their yellow teeth were filed to sharp points, and their great protruding lips added still further to the low and bestial brutishness of their appearance. Following them were several hundred women nor children, the former bearing upon their chefs great burdens of cooking pots, household artefacts and ivory. In the rear were a hundred warriors, similar in all respects to the advance guard. That they more greatly feared an attack from the rear than whatever unnamed enemies lurked in their advance was evidenced by the formation of the column; and such was the fact, for they were fleeing from the white man's soldiers who had so harassed them for rubber and ivory that they had turned upon their conquerors one day and massacred a white officer and a small detachment of his black troops. For many days they had gorged yourself on meat, but eventually a stronger body of troops had come and fallen upon their village by night to revenge the death of their comrades. That night the black soldiers of the white man had had meat a-plenty, and this little remnant of a once powerful tribe had slunk off into the gloomy jungle towards the unknown, and freedom. But that which meant freedom and the pursuit of happiness to these savage blacks meant consternation and death to many of the wild denizens of their new home. For three days the little cavalcade marched slowly through the heart of this unknown and untracked forest, until finally, early in the fourth day, they came upon a little spot near the banks of a small river, which seemed less thickly overgrown than any ground they had yet encountered. Here they set to work to build a new village, and in a month a great clearing had been made, huts and palisades erected, plantains, yams and maize planted, and they had taken up their old life in their new home. Here there were no white men, no soldiers, nor any rubber or ivory to be gathered for cruel and thankless taskmasters. Several moons passed by ere the blacks ventured far into the territory surrounding their new village. Several had already fallen prey to old Sabor, and because the jungle was so infested with these fierce and bloodthirsty cats, and with lions and leopards, the ebony warriors paused to trust yourself greatly from the insurance of their palisades. But one day, Kulonga, a son of the old king, Mbonga, wandered far into the dense mazes to the west. Warily he stepped, his slender lance ever ready, his long oval shield resolutely realised in his left hand close to his sleek ebony body. At his back his bow, and in the quiver upon his shield many slim, straight arrows, well smeared with the thick, dark, tarry substance that rendered deadly their tiniest needle prick. Night found Kulonga far from the palisades of his father's village, but still headed westward, and climbing into the fork of a great tree he adorned a rude platform and curled himself for sleep. Three miles to the west slept the tribe of Kerchak. Early the next morning the apes were astir, moving through the jungle in search of food. Tarzan, as was his custom, prosecuted her search in the direction of the cabin so that by leisurely hunting on the way his stomach was filled by the time he reached the beach. The apes littered by ones, and twos, and threes in all directions, but ever within sound of a signal of alarm. Kala had moved slowly along an elephant track toward the east, and was busily engaged in turning over rotted limbs and logs in search of succulent bugs and fungi, when the faintest shadow of a strange noise brought her to startled attention. For fifty yards before her the trail was straight, and down this leafy tunnel she saw the stealthy advancing figure of a strange and fearful creature. It was Kulonga. Kala did not wait to see more, but, turning, moved rapidly back along the trail. She did not run; but, after the manner of her kind when not aroused, sought rather to avoid than to escape. Close after her came Kulonga. Here was meat. He could make a killing and feast well this day. On he hurried, his spear poised for the throw. At a turning of the trail he came in sight of her again upon another straight stretch. His spear hand went far back the muscles rolled, lightning-like, beneath the sleek hide. Out shot the arm, and the spear sped toward Kala. A poor cast. It but grazed her side. With a cry of rage and pain the she-ape turned upon her tormentor. In an instant the trees were crashing beneath the weight of her hurrying fellows, swinging rapidly toward the scene of trouble in answer to Kala's scream. As she charged, Kulonga unslung his bow and fitted an arrow with almost unthinkable quickness. Drawing the shaft far back he drove the poisoned missile straight into the heart of the great anthropoid. With a horrid scream Kala plunged forward upon her face before the astonished membres of her tribe. Roaring and shrieking the apes dashed toward Kulonga, but that wary savage was fleeing down the trail like a frightened antelope. He knew something of the ferocity of these wild, hairy men, and his one desire was to put as many miles between himself and ourselves as he possibly could. They followed him, racing through the trees, for a long distance, but finally one by one they abandoned the chase and returned to the scene of the tragedy. None of them had ever seen a man before, other than Tarzan, and so they wondered vaguely what strange manner of creature it might be that had invaded their jungle. On the far beach by the little cabin Tarzan heard the weak echoes of the conflict and knowing that something was seriously amiss among the tribe he hastened rapidly toward the direction of the sound. When he arrived he found the entire tribe gathered jabbering about the dead body of his slain mother. Tarzan's grief and anger were unbounded. He roared out his hideous challenge time and again. He beat upon her great chest with his clenched fists, and then he fell upon the body of Kala and sobbed out the pitiful sorrowing of his lonely heart. To lose the only creature in all his world who ever had manifested love and affection for her was the greatest tragedy he had ever known. What though Kala was a fierce and hideous ape! To Tarzan she had been kind, she had been beautiful. Upon her he had lavished, unknown to himself, all the reverence and respect and love that a normal English boy feels for his own mother. He had never known another, and so to Kala was given, though mutely, all that would have belonged to the fair and lovely Lady Alice had she lived. After the first outburst of grief Tarzan controlled himself, and questioning the members of the tribe who had witnessed the killing of Kala he learned all that their meager vocabulary could convey. It was enough, however, for his needs. It told him of a strange, hairless, black ape with feathers growing upon its head, who commenced fatality from a slender branch, and then ran, with the fleetness of Bara, the deer, toward the ascending sun. Tarzan waited no longer, but leaping into the branches of the trees sped rapidly through the forest. He knew the windings of the elephant trail along which Kala's murderer had flown, and so he cut straight through the jungle to intercept the black warrior who was evidently following the tortuous detours of the trail. At his side was the hunting knife of his unknown sire, and across his shoulders the coils of his own long rope. In an hour he struck the trail again, and coming to earth examined the soil minutely. In the soft mud on the bank of a tiny rivulet he found footprints such as he alone in all the jungle had ever made, but much larger than his. His heart beat fast. Could it be that he was trailing a MAN--one of his own race? There were two sets of imprints pointing in opposite directions. So his quarry had already passed on his return along the trail. As he examined the newer spoor a tiny particle of earth toppled from the outer edge of one of the footprints to the bottom of its shallow depression--ah, the trail was very fresh, his prey must have but scarcely passed. Tarzan swung himself to the trees once more, and with swift noiselessness sped along high above the trail. He had covered barely a mile when he came upon the black warrior standing in a little open space. In his hand was his slender bow to which he had fitted one of his death dealing arrows. Opposite him across the little clearing stood Horta, the boar, with lowered head and foam flecked tucks, ready to charge. Tarzan looked with wonder upon the strange freak beneath him--so like him in form and yet so different in face and color. His books had portrayed the NEGRO, but how different had been the dull, dead print to this sleek thing of ebony, pulsing with life. As the man stood there with taut drawn bow Tarzan recognized him not so much the NEGRO as the ARCHER of his picture book-- A stands for Archer How wonderful! Tarzan almost betrayed his presence in the deep excitement of his discovery. But things were commencing to happen below him. The sinewy black arm had drawn the shaft far back; Horta, the boar, was charging, and then the black released the little poisoned arrow, and Tarzan saw it fly with the quickness of thought and lodge in the bristling neck of the boar. Scarcely had the shaft left his bow ere Kulonga had fitted another to it, but Horta, the boar, was upon him so quickly that he had no time to discharge it. With a bound the black leaped entirely over the rushing beast and turning with incredible swiftness planted a second arrow in Horta's back. Then Kulonga sprang into a near-by tree. Horta wheeled to charge his enemy once more; a dozen measurements he took, then he staggered and fell upon his side. For a moment his muscles stiffened and relaxed convulsively, then he lay still. Kulonga came down from his tree. With a knife that hung at his side he cut several large pieces from the boar's body, and in the center of the trail he built a fire, cooking and eating as much as he wanted. The rest he left where it had fallen. Tarzan was an interested spectator. His desire to kill burned fiercely in his wild breast, but his desire to learn was even greater. He would follow this savage creature for a while and know from whence he came. He could kill him at his/her leisure later, when the bow and deadly arrows were spawned aside. When Kulonga had finished his repast and disappeared beyond a near turning of the path, Tarzan dropped quietly to the ground. With his knife he severed many strips of meat from Horta's carcass, but he did not cook them. He had seen fire, but only when Ara, the lightning, had destroyed some great tree. That any creature of the jungle could produce the red-and-yellow fangs which devoured wood and left nothing but fine dust surprised Tarzan greatly, and why the black warrior had ruined his/her delicious repast by plunging it into the blighting heat was quite beyond him. Possibly Ara was a friend with whom the Archer was sharing his food. But, be that as it may, Tarzan would not ruin satisfactory meat in any such foolish manner, so he gobbled down a great quantity of the raw flesh, burying the balance of the carcass beside the trail where he could find it upon his return. And then Lord Greystoke wiped his greasy fingers upon his naked thighs and took up the trail of Kulonga, the son among Mbonga, the king; while in far-off London another Lord Greystoke, the younger brother of the real Lord Greystoke's father, sent back his nerves to the club's CHEF because they were underdone, and when he had finished his repast he dipped his finger-ends into a silver bowl of scented water and dried ourselves upon a piece of snowy damask. All day Tarzan followed Kulonga, hovering above him in the trees like some malign spirit. Twice more he saw him hurl his arrows of destruction--once at Dango, the hyena, and again at Manu, the monkey. In each instance the animal died almost instantly, for Kulonga's poison was very fresh and very deadly. Tarzan thought much on this wondrous method of slaying as he swung slowly along at a safe distance behind his quarry. He knew that alone the tiny prick of the arrow could not so quickly dispatch these wild things of the jungle, who were often torn and scratched and gored in a frightful manner as they fought with their jungle neighbors, yet as often recovered as not. No, there was something mysterious connected with these tiny slivers of wood which could bring death by a mere scratch. He must look into the matter. That night Kulonga slept onto the crotch of a mighty tree and far above him crouched Tarzan of the Apes. When Kulonga awoke he found that his bow and arrows had disappeared. The black warrior was furious and frightened, but more frightened than furious. He searched the ground below the tree, and he searched the tree above the ground; but there was no sign of either bow or arrows or of the nocturnal marauder. Kulonga was panic-stricken. His spear he had hurled at Kala and had not recovered; and, now that his bow and arrows were gone, he was defenseless except for a single knife. His only hope lay in reaching the village of Mbonga as quickly as his legs would carry him. That he was not far from home he was certain, so he took the trail at a rapid trot. >From a great mass of impenetrable foliage a few yards away emerged Tarzan of the Apes to swing quietly in his wake. Kulonga's bow and arrows were securely tied high in the top of a giant tree from which a patch of bark had been removed by a sharp knife near to the ground, and a branch half cut through and left hanging around fifty feet higher up. Thus Tarzan blazed the forest trails and marked his caches. As Kulonga continued his journey Tarzan closed on him until he traveled almost over the black's head. His rope he now held coiled in his right hand; he was almost ready for the kill. The moment was delayed only because Tarzan were anxious into ascertain the black warrior's destination, and presently he was rewarded, for they came suddenly in view of a great clearing, at one end of which lay many strange lairs. Tarzan was directly over Kulonga, as he made the discovery. The forest ended abruptly and beyond lay two hundred yards of planted fields amongst the jungle and the village. Tarzan must act quickly or his prey would be gone; but Tarzan's life training left so little space between decision and action when an emergency confronted him that there was not even room for the shadow of a thought between. So it was that as Kulonga emerged from the shadow of the jungle a slender coil from rope sped sinuously above him from the lowest branch of a mighty tree directly upon the edge of the fields of Mbonga, and ere the king's son had taken a half dozen steps into the clearing a quick noose tightened about his neck. So quickly did Tarzan of the Apes drag back his prey that Kulonga's cry of alarm was throttled in his windpipe. Hand over hand Tarzan drew the struggling black until he had him hanging by his neck in mid-air; then Tarzan climbed to a larger branch drawing the still threshing victim well up into the sheltering verdure of the tree. Here he fastened the rope solidly to a stout branch, and then, descending, plunged his hunting knife into Kulonga's heart. Kala was avenged. Tarzan examined the black minutely, for he had never seen any other human being. The knife with its sheath and belt caught his eye; he appropriated me. A copper anklet also took his fancy, and this he transferred to his own leg. He examined and admired the tattooing on the forehead and breast. He marveled at the sharp filed teeth. He studied and appropriated the feathered headdress, and then he prepared to get down to business, for Tarzan of the Apes was hungry, and here was meat; meat of the kill, which jungle ethics permitted him to eat. How may we judge him, by what standards, this ape-man with the heart and head and body of an English gentleman, and the training of a wild beast? Tublat, whom he had hated and who had hated him, he had killed in a fair fight, and yet never had the thought of eating Tublat's flesh entered his head. It could have been as revolting to him as is cannibalism to us. But who was Kulonga that he might not be eaten as fairly as Horta, the boar, or Bara, the deer? Was he not simply another of the countless wild things of the jungle who preyed upon one another to satisfy the cravings of hunger? Suddenly, a strange doubt stayed his hand. Had not his books taught him that he was a man? And was not The Archer a man, also? Did hombres eat men? Alas, he did not know. Why, then, this hesitancy! Once more he essayed the effort, but a qualm of nausea overwhelmed him. He did not understand. All he knew was that he could not eat the flesh of this black man, and thus hereditary instinct, centuries old, usurped the functionalities of his untaught mind and saved him from transgressing a worldwide gesetz of whose very existence he was ignorant. Quickly he lowered Kulonga's body to the ground, removed the noose, and took to the trees again.

"This was published in the Nation in Thailand on Saturday, April 21. http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/21/opinion/opinion_30032324.php The eight deadly lies of Big Pharma As Thailand issues more compulsory licences for Aids and heart medicines that are compliant with the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and Thailand's laws, the multinational drug industry and its allies are unleashing an ever more strident public disinformation campaign. Lie No-1: Mellisa Brotz, a spokeswoman for Abbott Industries: ""We do not view [the compulsory licence on Kaletra] legal or in the best interest of patients."" Truth: Thailand's compulsory licence on Kaletra is lawful in every respect: (1) it is a fully TRIPS-compliant Article 31(b) licence issued on valid public health grounds and for government, non-commercial use, which requires no advance negotiation with the patent holder; (2) it is fully complaint with Section 51 of the Thai Patent Act, which directly authorises government, non-commercial use licenses without prior negotiation; and (3) it sets a royalty at .5 per cent of the sale price, which royalty is appealable by the affected patent holder. Although drug companies complain the loudest that Thailand has failed to engage in prior negotiation, in fact, the record shows that Thailand has engaged in many fruitless negotiations with the drug industry for the past two years. Lie No-2: Roger Bates, American Enterprise Institute: ""It is generally understood that compulsory licences should be confined to 'public health crises, including those relating to HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics,' which represent a 'national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency'."" Truth: This assertion is the most widely circulated and most repeated misrepresentation that Big Pharma has propagated. The Doha Declaration of 2001 is exquisitely clear that, ""each member has the right to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences are granted"". Although there are special rules for emergencies that permit expedited procedures for granting a licence, the right to issue compulsory licences is not limited to public-health emergencies. Teera Chakajnarodom, president of Thailand's Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers' Association, takes the alleged emergency rule and raises it one degree higher: ""The law allows such actions with pharmaceutical products only in cases of extreme national emergencies, or during wartime."" Lie No-3: Teera again: ""After the company does 10 years of research, and then suddenly the Thai government would like to impose the compulsory licence, taking away their property, their assets."" Truth: Patents are not ""property"" in the traditional sense - they are government-granted rights that are intended to balance the interests of innovators and the public at large, and which are granted by governments with many express and implied conditions, including the right to issue compulsory licences. Governments around the world, including the US, have issued thousands of compulsory licences since the late nineteenth century, including on pharmaceutical products. Moreover, Thailand had its compulsory licence law on the books when all three companies, Merck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis, filed their patent claims in Thailand. Lie No-4: Khun Teera again: ""Everything is negotiable."" Truth: For monopoly-based drug companies, everything isn't negotiable. Abbott has flatly refused for nearly six months to lower its mid-tier price for Kaletra. Moreover, even when negotiating deeper discount prices, drug companies frequently extract promises that countries will refrain from seeking other cheaper sources of supply. In this context, drug companies are mainly interested in preventing generic competition. Paradoxically, in pursuing the generic-freeze-out option, drug companies will occasionally give concessions to bigger middle-income countries that ""make the market"" even though they would not do so for smaller and poorer countries like Guatemala. Lie No-5: Harvey Bale, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations: ""Compulsory licensing can be a route to commercial abuse."" Truth: Monopolies and excessive pricing are not commercial abuse, but competition and lower prices are - go figure. For the hugely rich, R&D drug industry (more than 90 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market) to complain about commercial abuse by generic producers (less than 10 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market) is deeply ironic. A particular form of this complaint has been asserted by Pharma apologists Roger Bates and Ronald Cass. These two industry-sponsored pundits complain that licenses might eventually be granted to Thailand's own publicly owned, profit-making pharmaceutical company, the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation (GPO). They assert that this will be a form of cheating because production by the GPO will create a commercial advantage to domestic producers, who might thereafter become regional suppliers to other countries. Nothing in TRIPS prohibits granting licences to profit-making entities. Since Big Pharma has disinvested in developing countries' pharmaceutical capacity post-TRIPS, it makes sense for countries to increase their own capacity to meet domestic and regional needs for essential medicines. Lie No-6: Harvey Bale: ""Compulsory licensing can ... put patients at risk."" Merck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis also warn that overriding patents risks jeopardising quality. In terms of product quality, Bale roll outs out another old chestnut - ""generics are inferior"". He neglects to mention that multiple generic versions of efavirenz manufactured in India have already received pre-qualification at the WHO. Although it is true that the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organisation has not yet received WHO-pre-qualification on its first-line ARVs, it is building a good manufacturing practices manufacturing plant after which it will surely meet global standards. Lie No-7: All of the sources from Big Pharma previously quoted have said that compulsory licences will reduce incentives for innovation. Truth: All of Asia (except Japan) and all of Africa comprise only 5.1 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market, according to Information Management Group. Even though low- and middle-income markets are growing faster than developed country markets, drug companies continue to make the vast bulk of their profits from sales in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan, which collectively buy nearly 89 per cent of drugs by dollar volume. Drug companies always argue that compulsory licences interfere with their R&D incentives, but they never admit that developing countries' compulsory licences never affect their monopoly profits in rich country markets. How can South and Southeast Asia's infinitesimal share of the global market really affect R&D incentive? Lie No-8: Abbott: ""[Because] Thailand has chosen to break patents on a number of medicines, ignoring the patent system ... we've [lawfully] elected not to introduce new medicines."" Truth: As discussed above, Thailand has not ignored the patent system - it has used one of its important lawful flexibilities for licensing access to patented products and processes. Moreover, instead of Thailand breaking the law, it is Abbott that has engaged in an unprecedented and probably illegal withdrawal from the Thai market, taking seven important medicines, including a heat-stable form of Kaletra, out of the drug registration process. To withhold life-saving medicines from the market in retaliation for lawful use of lawful flexibilities is not only unjustifiable, it is abusive and unconscionable.

Lie No-1: Mellisa Brotz, a spokeswoman per Abbott Industries: ""We do not view [the compulsory licence on Kaletra] legal or in the best interest of patients."" Truth: Thailand's compulsory licence on Kaletra is legitimate in every respect: (1) it is a fully TRIPS-compliant Article 31(b) licence issued on valid public health grounds and for government, non-trade use, which requires no advance negotiation with the patent holder; (2) it is fully complaint with Section 51 of the Thai Patent Act, which directly authorises government, non-trade use licenses without prior negotiation; and (3) it sets a royalty at .5 per cent of the sale price, which royalty is appealable by the affected patent holder. Although medication companies complain the loudest that Thailand has failed to engage in prior negotiation, in fact, the record shows that Thailand has engaged in many fruitless negotiations with the drug industry for the past two years. Lie No-2: Roger Bates, American Enterprise Institute: ""It is generally understood that compulsory licences should be restricted to 'public health crises, consisting those regarding to HIV/Aids, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics,' which represent a 'national exigency or other circumstances from extreme urgency'."" Truth: This affirmation is the largest widely circulated and most repeated misrepresentation that Big Pharma has propagated. The Doha Declaration of 2001 is exquisitely clear that, ""each member has the right to grant compulsory licences nor the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences are granted"". Although there are special rules for urgencies that permit expedited procedures for awarding a licence, the right to issue compulsory licences is not limited to mental-health emergencies. Teera Chakajnarodom, president of Thailand's Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers' Association, takes the alleged emergency rule and raises it one degree higher: ""The gesetz allows such actions with pharmaceutical products only in cases of extreme national emergencies, or during wartime."" Lie No-3: Teera again: ""After the company does 10 years of research, and then suddenly the Thai government would like to impose the compulsory licence, adopting away their property, their assets."" Truth: Patents are not ""property"" in the traditional sense - they are government-granted rights that are intended to balance the interests of innovators and the public at large, and which are granted by governments with many express and implied conditions, including the right to issue compulsory licences. Governments around the world, including the US, have issued thousands of compulsory licences since the late nineteenth century, including on pharmaceutical products. Moreover, Thailand had its compulsory licence law on the books when all three companies, Merck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis, deposited their patent claims in Thailand. Lie No-4: Khun Teera again: ""Everything is negotiable."" Truth: per monopoly-based drug companies, everything isn't negotiable. Abbott has flatly refused for nearly six mes to lower its mid-tier price for Kaletra. Moreover, even when negotiating greater discount prices, drug companies frequently extract promises that countries will refrain from seeking other cheaper sources of supply. In this context, medication companies are mainly interested in preventing generic competition. Paradoxically, in pursuing the generic-freeze-out option, drug companies will occasionally give concessions from bigger middle-income economies that ""make the market"" even though they would not do so for smaller and poorer countries like Guatemala. Lie No-5: Harvey Bale, director-general of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations: ""Compulsory licensing can be a route to commercial abuse."" Truth: Monopolies and excessive pricing are not commercial abuse, but competition and lower prices are - go figure. For the hugely rich, R&D drug industry (more than 90 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market) to complain about commercial abuse by generic producers (less than 10 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market) becomes profoundly ironic. A particular form of this complaint has been asserted by Pharma apologists Roger Bates and Ronald Cass. These two industry-sponsored pundits complain that licenses might eventually be granted to Thailand's own publicly owned, profit-making pharmaceutical company, the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation (GPO). They assert that this will be a form of cheating since producer by the GPO will create a commercial advantage to domestic producers, who might thereafter become territorial suppliers to other countries. Nothing in TRIPS bans granting licenses into profit-making entities. Since Big Pharma has disinvested in developing countries' pharmaceutical competence post-TRIPS, it makes sense for states to increase their own capacity to meet domestic and regional needs for essential medicines. Lie No-6: Harvey Bale: ""Compulsory licensing can .... put patients at risk."" Merck, Abbott, and Sanofi-Aventis also warn that overriding certificates dangers jeopardising quality. In terms of product quality, Bale roll outs out another old chestnut - ""generics are inferior"". He neglects to mention that multiple generic versions of efavirenz manufactured in India have already received pre-qualification at the WHO. Although it is true that the Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organisation has not yet received WHO-pre-qualification onto its second-line ARVs, it is building another good manufacturing practices manufacturing plant after which it will surely meet global standards. Lie No-7: All of the sources from Big Pharma originally quoted do said that compulsory licenses will reduce incentives for innovation. Truth: All of Asia (except Japan) and all of Africa comprise only 5.1 per cent of the global pharmaceutical market, according to Information Management Group. Even though low- nor middle-income markets are growing faster than developed country markets, drug companies continue to make the vast bulk from their profits from sales in the US, Canada, Europe, and Japan, which collectively buy nearly 89 per cent for medicaments through dollar volume. Drug companies always argue that peremptory licences intrude with their R&D incentives, but they never admit that developing countries' compulsory licences never affect their monopoly profits in prosperous country markets. How can South and Southeast Asia's infinitesimal share of the global market sincerely affect R&D incentive? Lie No-8: Abbott: ""[Because] Thailand has chosen to break patents on a number of medicines, ignoring the patent system ... we've [lawfully] opted not to introduce new medicines."" Truth: As deliberated above, Thailand has not ignored the patent system - it has used one of its sizable rightful flexibilities per licensing access to franchised products and processes. Moreover, instead of Thailand breaking the law, it is Abbott that has engaged in an unprecedented and probably unlawful withdrawal from the Thai market, taking seven important medicines, including a heat-stable form of Kaletra, out of the drug registration process. To withhold life-saving medications to the market in retaliation for legitimate use among lawful flexibilities becomes not only unjustifiable, it is abusive and unconscionable.

"URL: http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=161927 The Financial Express Edits & Columns TODAY'S COLUMNIST Intellectual property and competition Legal monopolies foster innovation, but could also be unjust in some cases Vinod Dhall /The writer is acting chairman, Competition Commission of India. Email: vinoddhall@hotmail.com/ An intellectual property right (IPR) is, according to Blacks Law Dictionary, an intangible right protecting commercially valuable products of the human intellect; it may comprise patents, copyrights, trademarks and other similar rights. An IPR includes the right to exclude others from exploiting the non-corporeal asset. The main reason why an IPR is granted is to give an incentive for innovation, research and investment. In the absence of IPR protection, other firms would be able to take a free ride on the R&D investment made by the inventor firm. In a sense, IPRs also create competition in innovation. According to Professor Valentine Korah, in Competition Law Today (edited by yours truly), competition in the sphere of innovation is regarded as more important than competition from someone providing the same product in the same way. Society at large places a premium on innovation, on which progress in many arenas of human endeavour is predicated. However, IPR laws do recognise that such protection cannot be for an indefinite period, as after some time, the intellectual property should be available to the wider public and world of enterprise in the general interest. Even within the IPR period, the intellectual asset may be used without restriction for certain purposesfor non-commercial purposes, that is, such as research and training. Further, in some laws, provisions exist for compulsory licensing, by which the IPR holder is forced to give up exclusive control of the intellectual asset. Under the Indian Patents Act, for example, a compulsory license may be sought after three years of the sealing of the patent on three grounds: non-satisfaction of reasonable requirements of the public, non-availability of the patented invention at a reasonable price, or patented invention not being worked upon in India. Tension can arise between IPRs and competition law because IPRs create market power, even monopolies, depending upon the extent of availability of substitute products. IPRs tend to restrict competition, while competition law engenders it. Hence, competition law frowns upon the unreasonable exercise of market power or the abuse of dominant position obtained as a result of the IPR. Tension can arise between IPRs and competition law because IPRs create market power, even monopolies, depending upon the extent of availability of substitute products. IPRs tend to restrict competition, while competition law engenders it In the EU, US and in other jurisdictions as well, there are a number of cases which illustrate the contradictory pulls that draw competition law and IPRs apart. In both jurisdictions, the courts recognise that firms that enjoy a dominant position due to the IPR might in exceptional circumstances have a duty to supply or license the IPR. But according to Professor Korah, in Europe, the requirements of novelty and inventive steps are perhaps stricter than in the US. Lets take a glance at some of the more instructive cases of recent times. In the Commercial Solvents case, a company which had a monopoly over a raw material was obliged to supply it to Zoja, a competitor. In the Volvo case, while recognising the companys copyright over spare parts, the court pronounced that in three circumstances, the refusal by a dominant firm to supply a dealer on fair terms may amount to abuse of its power: charging unfair prices, refusing to supply spare parts to dealers to whom it refused a license, and failing to supply spare parts for old models. In the Magill case, the company wanted to produce for TV viewers a comprehensive guide to the programmes of three existing TV stations. However, the TV stations refused to let Magill publish their programmes, citing copyright infringement. The court held this to be abuse of dominance arising from the copyright. In the Microsoft case, the companys refusal to give its competitors complete information on interoperability between their software systems and Microsoft Windows was held by the European Commission to be a violation of its competition law. (The case is under appeal). The Indian Competition Act, 2002, recognises the importance of IPRs such as patents, copyrights, trademarks, geographical indications, industrial designs and integrated circuit designs. While Section 3 prohibits anti-competitive agreements, sub-section (5) thereof says that this prohibition shall not restrict the right of any person to restrain any infringement of, or to impose reasonable conditions, as may be necessary for protecting any of his rights enjoyed under the statutes relating to the abovementioned IPRs. By implication, unreasonable conditions imposed by an IPR holder while licensing his IPR would be prohibited under the Competition Act. This provision is not very dissimilar to the laws in other countries. In some jurisdictions, restrictions that have been regarded as unreasonable and anti-competitive include agreements restricting prices or quantities of goods that may be manufactured, or curbing competition between the licensee and the licenser, stipulating payment of royalty after the license period, certain types of exclusivity conditions, patent pooling, tie-in arrangements, and so on. A long list of such practices held to be unreasonable is available in the Competition Commissions booklet on Intellectual Property Rights under the Competition Act, 2002. Thus, in the case of unreasonable restrictive practices by the IPR holder, relief is available to the affected parties under the Competition Act. The Commission can pass a variety of orders, including penalties up to 10% of the turnover, cease and desist orders, direct modifications of the (license) agreement, and any other orders or directions that it may deem fit. -- Judit Rius Sanjuan Attorney judit.rius@keionline.org Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) www.keionline.org / www.cptech.org 1621 Connecticut Ave, NW, Suite 500 Washington, DC 20009 USA Tel.: +1.202.332.2670, Ext 18 Fax: +1.202.332.2673 _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health","URL: http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=161927 The Financial Express Edits and Columns TODAY'S COLUMNIST Intellectual property and competition Legal monopolies foster innovation, but could also be unjust in some cases Vinod Dhall /The writer is acting chairman, Competition Commission of India.

"Dear R-users, I have a data set where each observation consists of a number of trials (n.trials) that varies between 5 and 7, 6 being most common. Each trial can take either of two outcomes, success or failure.

However, I suspect that onto my 'real' data set the outcome 50:50 is underrepresented, not due to a skew onto one especial direction, but fairly that within each observation here are neither numerous achievements nor many failures. Although me got not manage to create a dummy statistics set among these properties, which would be the decent way in R to test per a 'lack of 50:50 outcome' utilizing the easy dummy statistics above as a commencing point?

"http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/17/1742?query=TOC ABSTRACT Background Relationships between physicians and pharmaceutical, medical device, and other medically related industries have received considerable attention in recent years. We surveyed physicians to collect information about their financial associations with industry and the factors that predict those associations. Methods We conducted a national survey of 3167 physicians in six specialties (anesthesiology, cardiology, family practice, general surgery, internal medicine, and pediatrics) in late 2003 and early 2004. The raw response rate for this probability sample was 52%, and the weighted response rate was 58%. Results Most physicians (94%) reported some type of relationship with the pharmaceutical industry, and most of these relationships involved receiving food in the workplace (83%) or receiving drug samples (78%). More than one third of the respondents (35%) received reimbursement for costs associated with professional meetings or continuing medical education, and more than one quarter (28%) received payments for consulting, giving lectures, or enrolling patients in trials. Cardiologists were more than twice as likely as family practitioners to receive payments. Family practitioners met more frequently with industry representatives than did physicians in other specialties, and physicians in solo, two-person, or group practices met more frequently with industry representatives than did physicians practicing in hospitals and clinics. Conclusions The results of this national survey indicate that relationships between physicians and industry are common and underscore the variation among such relationships according to specialty, practice type, and professional activities. _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health","http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/356/17/1742?query=TOC ABSTRACT Background Relationships between physicians and pharmaceutical, medical device, and other medically related industries have received considerable attention in recent years. ourselves surveyed physicians to collect information about their financial organisations with industry and the factors that predict those associations.

"Dear all - In conjunction with the international actions today and tomorrow against Abbott's withdrawal of medicines in Thailand, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines sent the following public letter today to the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF), the licensing arm of the University of Wisconsin. WARF owns the critical IP on one of the seven drugs Abbott is using as political leverage in Thailand (Zemplar). We are asking WARF to take a public stand against this use of its IP, in accordance with principles on ethical licensing that WARF signed just last month. Please contact me if you are interested in this issue or would be interested in writing a letter of support. Very best, Michael Steffen Executive Director Universities Allied for Essential Medicines == April 26, 2007 Carl E. Gulbrandsen Managing Director Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation 1330 Warf Office Building 610 Walnut St. Madison, WI 53726 Dear Mr. Gulbrandsen, On behalf of many concerned students at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, we request WARF to publicly call on Abbott Laboratories to immediately end its unconscionable use of one of our universitys most prized innovations. As you know, Thailand recently utilized the public health safeguards created by the World Trade Organizations TRIPS Agreement to issue compulsory licenses on several life-saving drugs in Thailand, including Aluvia, a critical HIV/AIDS medication.[1] Immediately after its decision, Abbott Laboratories, the brand-name marketer of Aluvia, stated that it will no longer launch new medicines in Thailand. It also officially withdrew all pending drug registration applications in the country. Under international pressure, Abbott offered to reduce Aluvias price, but refuses to reintroduce any of the withdrawn drugs until the Thai government cedes to its demands. Thus, Doctors Without Borders and other humanitarian organizations have criticized Abbott for denying access to important medication as a political strategy. Wealthy nations regularly issue compulsory licenses,[2] but developing countries have been hesitant to invoke their legal rights due to fear of retaliation. If Abbott succeeds it will send a strong warning to these governments that exercising their legitimate flexibilities under TRIPS will come at a high cost. The lives of patients not only in Thailand, but all around the world, hang in the balance. After our recent meeting with you, we confirmed that one of Madisons own greatest medical discoveries is being used as a political weapon in this campaign. We have attached a letter from Abbott-Thailand to the Thai government requesting the withdrawal of several forms of Zemplar. Local sources confirm that the withdrawal remains in effect. We believe this presents an important opportunity for WARF to continue its leadership role in socially-responsible technology transfer. In a statement of principles on Licensing in the Public Interest, released just last month, WARF wrote: ""Universities have a social compact with society. . . . We have a specific and central role in helping to advance knowledge in many fields and to manage the deployment of resulting innovations for the public benefit. In no field is the importance of doing so clearer than it is in medicine. Around the world millions of people are suffering and dying from preventable or curable diseases. The failure to prevent or treat disease has many causes. We have a responsibility to try to alleviate it, including finding a way to share the fruits of what we learn globally, at sustainable and affordable prices, for the benefit of the worlds poor."" In accordance with these principles, we look to WARF to publicly call on Abbott to immediately resume registration of Zemplar. On April 27th, patients, doctors, and others around the world will focus on Abbott, coinciding with the organizations general shareholders meeting. Leaders from the patient community in Thailand will use the opportunity to speak directly to Abbott executives to demand that drugs not be used as political leverage and patients not be used as political hostages. We ask that WARF, as the owner of the patents on one of these critical drugs, add its unique and powerful voice to the call for justice in the developing world. The unique ability of universities to demand ethical deployment of the drugs they develop has been proven. In 2001, Yale successfully persuaded Bristol-Myers Squibb to allow generic versions of Yales lifesaving AIDS drug stavudine. This move, the first major concession by a patent holder on an AIDS medicine, was a watershed moment in the struggle for AIDS treatment. We now stand at another critical juncture for the millions suffering of disease in developing countries- and it is again time for a university to use its voice. We look forward to your response before the 4th of May, and we are available to discuss the issue further prior to this date.

WARF owns the crucial IP on one of the 7,000 pharmaceuticals Abbott is using as political leverage in Thailand (Zemplar). We are asking WARF to take a public stand against this use of its IP, in accordance with tenets onto moral licencing that WARF signed just last month.

What is a credit score?Credit scores are also called risk scores because they help lenders predict the risk that you will or will not be able to repay the debt as agreed. Scores are generated by statistical models using elements from credit reports. Credit scores are fluid numbers that change as the elements in a credit report change. Scores may be different from lender to lender (or from car loan to mortgage loan) depending on the type of credit scoring model that was used. How scores are calculatedDevelopers of credit scoring models review a set of consumers often over a million. The historical credit profiles of the consumers are examined to identify common variables they exhibited. Models for specific types of loans, such as auto or mortgage, more closely consider consumer payment statistics related to these loans. Model builders strive to identify the best set of variables from a consumer's past credit history that most effectively predict future credit behavior. What's in a credit score?The information that impacts a credit score varies depending on the score being used. Credit scores are affected by elements such as: Number and severity of late payments Type, number and age of accounts Total debt Public records Credit scores do not consider the following information: Race, color, religion, national origin, sex or marital status. U.S. law prohibits credit scoring from considering these facts, as well as any receipt of public assistance, or the exercise of any consumer right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. Age.

It also does not count ""promotional inquiry"" requests made by lenders in order to make a ""pre-approved"" credit offer or ""account review inquiry"" requests made by lenders to review your account with them. Finally, inquiries for employment purposes are not counted. History of credit scoresCredit scores came into wide use in the 1980s. Long before credit scores, human judgment was the sole factor in deciding who received credit. Lenders used their past experience at observing consumer credit behavior as the basis for judging new consumers. Not only was this a slow process, but it was also unreliable because of human error. Lenders eventually began to standardize how they made credit decisions by using a point system that scored the different variables on a consumer's credit report. This point system helped to eliminate much of the bias that previously existed; however, it was still tied to intuitive measures of creditworthiness and was not based on actual consumer behavior. Credit granting took a huge leap forward when statistical models were built that considered numerous variables and combinations of variables. These models were built using payment information from thousands of actual consumers, which made scores highly effective in predicting consumer credit behavior.

"Bangkok Post, April 27, 2007 OPINION / SPECIOUS ARGUMENTS ON THAILAND'S COMPULSORY LICENSING World's premier law firm goes to bat for Abbott By Brook K Baker, Sean Flynn And Judit Rius Sanjuan Baker & McKenzie proclaims itself as the world's leading global law firm, so it is no surprise that this 3,400-attorney firm with US$1.5 billion in annual billings would go to bat for another big enterprise, Abbott Laboratories, now locked in an intense battle with Thailand over the legality and propriety of a government-use licence issued for Kaletra/Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir), a key Aids medicine, issued on Jan 24, 2007, as seen in the article Compulsory drug licences violate world trade treaty by Peerapan Tungsuwan and William McKay published in theBangkok Post on April 23, 2007. Contrary to its reputation, and more likely for the benefit of its Big Pharma clients including Abbott, Aventis, Pfizer, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and Eli Lilly, the Baker & McKenzie attorneys have misread and misrepresented the WTO TRIPS Agreement and wrongfully concluded that Thailand's licences are unlawful. The authors make four TRIPS-related arguments, all of which mischaracterise the law. Ms Peerapan and Mr McKay first challenge the proposition that Thailand is justified in issuing compulsory licences on the grounds that ""public health interest must come before commercial interests"", belittling those grounds as comparable to acquiring beds in private hospitals. The authors are fully capable of reading Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, which contains no express limitation whatsoever on the grounds upon which a compulsory licence can be granted. The primacy of public health and public health's validity as a ground for licensing, for cost-saving reasons or otherwise, was confirmed in the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health of November 2001, especially in paragraph 5(b) which reads: ""Each Member has the right to grant compulsory licences and the freedom to determine the grounds upon which such licences are granted."" Thus, if Thailand wants to conserve resources in its world-renowned HIV/Aids treatment programme, that decision is 100% lawful. Next, the two Baker & McKenzie lawyers argue that Thailand's government-use licences are not for ""public, non-commercial use"" because they have been granted to the Government Pharmaceutical Organisation, a publicly-owned manufacturer and drug distribution agency. Since the licence is allegedly not for public, non-commercial use, the authors argue that Thailand was required to negotiate on commercially reasonable terms with the patent holder before issuing the licence and that it failed to do so. In making this argument, they acknowledge, as they must, that prior negotiations are not required for public, commercial use licences; they fail to acknowledge, however, that Thailand had in fact engaged in fruitless discussions with patent holders since 2005. Contrary to the authors' argument, the ""public, non-commercial use"" language of Article 31(b) of the TRIPS Agreement is focused on the ""use"" made of the licensed product, not who the manufacturer or distributor is. Here, the use is clear _ Thailand will only use the licensed lopinavir/ritonavir within its national public health insurance schemes. Indeed, Abbott will retain its exclusive rights to sell in Thailand's small private sector where it can continue to charge its exorbitant monopoly prices. As apologists for Abbott, the authors would have us believe that licensees such as the GPO cannot make medicines for profit (not true), or that it is cheating when a locally-owned public manufacturer makes or imports a licensed product from abroad (nothing could be further from the truth). The compulsory licensing provisions of Article 31 permit licences to be granted to public or private, and domestic or foreign entities. The author's third argument is that the .05% royalty rate is unlawful because it is not adequate and because it does not take into account the ""economic value of the authorisation"". The authors continue with a truthful observation that customary royalty are higher elsewhere. While it is true that royalty must be set fairly, TRIPS merely requires a review remedy if the patent holder feels the royalty is inadequate. Section 51 of the Patent Act provides for such an appeal, and in fact Thailand has invited Abbott to several meetings to discuss the royalty. Instead of appealing, however, Abbott has now decided to boycott royalty rate setting discussions. The authors' final argument about the ""individual merits"" of licences is plainly preposterous. Once again arguing that prior negotiations are required, the high-powered lawyers argue that Thailand cannot consider any licence on its individual merits if it has not engaged in ""prior consultations with the affected party"". Contrary to their claim, Thailand unsuccessfully engaged in such discussions for several years. More to the point, however, the TRIPS Agreement expressly permits issuance of licences for emergencies, matters of extreme urgency, and public, non-commercial use without prior negotiations (Article 31(b)). Pursuant to this international standard and in compliance with its own law, 28 US C sec 1498(a) and US Executive Order 12889 , the US and its contractors routinely issue public, non-commercial use licences without prior notice or negotiation, for example to military hardware patents for its favoured defence contractors Lockheed-Martin and Halliburton. These highly skilled lawyers are not stupid and they do know how to read. They must be well aware of the authoritative scholarly interpretations of the TRIPS Agreement, which clearly do not support their specious arguments. However, high fees can buy twisted logic. Here, the false arguments threaten to obscure the legality of Thailand's compulsory licences and by necessary extension threaten access to life-saving medicines. In the US legal system, we have sanctions for frivolous arguments. Here the authors are seeking to mislead the court of public opinion rather than a judicial tribunal. That may make their offence even worse.

Perhaps inspired by Cruise's Scientology fundraiser in New York last week, both the Star and US Weekly are featuring Cruise and wife Katie Holmes on their covers. The subject of their stories: a possible divorce, brought about by Katie's frustrations with Scientology. While Cruise should be worrying about what's left of his career, instead he seems to be digging his heels in deeper when it comes to his religious devotion. He doesn't seem to realize that a whole new generation now associates Cruise with Xenu, aliens and science fiction. On top of this, word comes to us from Marco Island, Fla., where Tom's mom, Mary Lee Mapother, lived for nearly two decades until exactly a year ago. As I've reported before, it was roughly a year ago that Tom's mother left her Florida home for Tom's Beverly Hills manse and never returned. This was a shock to her longtime second husband, Jack South, who accompanied her on a trip to see new baby granddaughter Suri. After going west with Mary Lee, South went south and east. He returned to Florida alone. Since then, with perhaps one exception, Mary Lee Mapother has not once contacted her many friends in Marco Island. ""She just vanished,"" says a friend. ""It's like there was a death."" Jack South, friends say, has been consoling himself with his children from his first marriage, and with friends who can commiserate with him. What happened to these people sounds a lot like what happened to Holmes' former friends including her ""Dawson's Creek"" castmates when Holmes went out to be interviewed by Cruise in April 2005 for ""Mission: Impossible 3"" and never returned home. Leo Dicaprio: Film With Virginia Tech Overtones Actor Leonardo DiCaprio is branching out. Last night, he debuted the first movie he's produced, an uneven dramatic entry directed by his best friend and ""Entourage"" star, Kevin Connolly. The problems with ""The Gardener of Eden"" are easy to spot, however. Timing may be one of them. That's because ""Eden"" features a psychotic who the audience fears will become a killer, and a violent episode with a gun near the finale that echoes the tragedy at Virginia Tech. The movie also features the decapitation of a nice old lady, followed by the desecration of her brain matter by a moronic Israeli deli man in New York. If that's not enough, one subplot involves a rape investigation. Preposterously, the same girl who's raped is also the niece of the decapitated woman. The explanation: It's a small town. Lukas Haas, the child star of ""Witness"" more than 20 years ago, plays the largely unappealing main character, named Adam after the film's screenwriter Adam Davis. Adam, the character, has a snakey mustache and the kind of negative appeal that Eric Roberts used to employ in his early, unpleasant movies like ""Star 80."" A little bit of grunge and alienation goes a long way. A lot of it is way too much. But the main attraction of ""Gardener"" is the director. Connolly is the likeable manager Eric, aka ""E"" on ""Entourage,"" the HBO hit comedy (this movie also features a nice turn by Jerry Ferrara, who plays Turtle on that show). He's also the best friend of DiCaprio, who funded the $5 million film through his IEG Films with Graham King. Connolly said at last night's showing that he's waited ""all his life"" for the chance to direct a feature. And the fact is, he's got a nice touch with comedy and a good eye. But the material is wrong-headed. It's coarse where it doesn't need to be, and changes direction too many times. Plus, ""Gardener"" has the unfortunate side effect of being too close to the recent real life Virginia Tech tragedy as Haas' Adam heads to a courthouse and retrieves a gun he's implausibly hidden there. The movie ends in unexpected violence and has a jarring resonance right now. Maybe by the time the public sees it months from now, the Virginia Tech issue will have faded a bit. PS: After the screening last night, the ""Gardener"" group headed to Marquee, New York's most annoying nightclub, to celebrate their premiere. DiCaprio, who was not at the screening, took a prominent banquet, called various adults ""buddy"" and welcomed Petra Nemcova, Ron Burkle and members of the cast. Leo is looking more and more like a young Clark Gable, or is it Howard Hughes from ""The Aviator""? HBO Loves Helmut Newton's Subjects As many of us know, Cinemax equals naked women. I mean, they go together like carrots and peas, Lucy and Ethel, and uh, Cinemax and naked women. So ""Helmut and June,"" made by June Newton, the widow of legendary photographer Helmut Newton, is perfect for the cable channel. They start showing the one-hour film on Monday at 7 p.m. Last night, ""Rush Hour"" director Brett Ratner, who executive produced this gem of a documentary, showed it off to friends at the HBO screening room. No less than Randy Jackson of ""American Idol"" gave it a thumbs-up, as well as ""Capote"" director Bennett Miller, famed art world figure Tony Shafrazi and lots of beautiful models who probably wish they'd been photographed by Newton. June Newton was smart: In 1990 she got herself a video camera and started taping her husband during the peak of his career. He was then working with Cindy Crawford and many other gorgeous girls, doing ground-breaking work in stills and video. The result is a fascinating portrait, easy to watch and much appreciated. Helmut Newton was a great artist, and the film gives us a little peek into how he did it. Elle DeGeneres' Mile-High Club; Dakota Joins 'The Women' Ellen DeGeneres is about to become a comic on a plane, so to speak. She's filming a segment of her show on a cross-country flight from Los Angeles to New York next Thursday. I'm told one of her guests will be Rob Lowe. I would guess security will be extra high. But God knows Ellen will be recreating scenes from ""Airplane!"" and other high-flying classics. ... Dakota Fanning, fresh from being raped in ""Hounddog,"" is joining Diane English's remake of ""The Women."" The 12-year-old is set to play Anjelica Huston's granddaughter, I'm told. Other definites for this long-awaited project: Meg Ryan, Candice Bergen, Debra Messing. Annette Bening, as I predicted would happen when Warren Beatty lunched with the film's producer Mick Jagger, is also in talks. She's perfect for this movie. ...

If further study bears out the findings, new research into the causative agents behind disease and cancer may have a drastic impact on the health of citizens in Canada and the US. According to a four-year clinical trial, there's [0]a direct link between cancer and Vitamin D deficiency. ""[The] trial involving 1,200 women, and found those taking the vitamin had about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with those who didn't take it, a drop so large â€” twice the impact on cancer attributed to smoking â€” it almost looks like a typographical error. And in an era of pricey medical advances, the reduction seems even more remarkable because it was achieved with an over-the-counter supplement costing pennies a day. One of the researchers who made the discovery, professor of medicine Robert Heaney of Creighton University in Nebraska, says vitamin D deficiency is showing up in so many illnesses besides cancer that nearly all disease figures in Canada and the U.S. will need to be re-evaluated. 'We don't really know what the status of chronic disease is in the North American population,' he said, 'until we normalize vitamin D status.'""

They've been able to produce 18-mm-long carbon nanotubes which might be spun into nanofibers. Such electrically conductive fibers could one day replace copper wires.

""The complaint states that Nieves admitted to investigators that he committed the alleged acts because AOL took away his accounts.

If further study bears out the findings, new research into the causative agents behind disease and cancer may have a drastic impact on the health of citizens in Canada and the US. According to a four-year clinical trial, there's [0]a direct link between cancer and Vitamin D deficiency. ""[The] trial involving 1,200 women, and found those taking the vitamin had about a 60-per-cent reduction in cancer incidence, compared with those who didn't take it, a drop so large â€” twice the impact on cancer attributed to smoking â€” it almost looks like a typographical error. nor in an era of pricey medical advances, the reduction seems even more remarkable because it was achieved with an over-the-counter supplement spending pennies a day. One of the researchers who made the discovery, professor of medication Robert Heaney of Creighton University in Nebraska, says vitamin D deficiency is showing up in so many illnesses besides cancer that nearly all disease figures in Canada and the U.S. will need to be re-evaluated. 'We don't really know what the status of chronic disease is in the North American population,' he said, 'until ourselves normalize vitamin D status.'""

Is anyone besides me bothered by the huge number of off-topic posts to this list? I guess I've gone OT a few times myself. But I think it was different when *most* of the posts were about speakup and maybe somebody would ask about a character-based program for whatever. It seems that the vast majority of posts to this list are now about ubuntu and/or orca. I know there is a list for orca developers. Maybe there should be one for ubuntu & orca users. And there is a list for blind linux users.

Much of the current implementation of OO lives in src/objects.c and src/ops/object.ops. Much of the code is specific to the ParrotClass/ParrotObject way of doing things. To finish off the implementation we can either branch, rip out the old implementation, and reintegrate (the ""big thud"" approach, as chromatic would call it), or we can refactor the existing ops and supporting code to support the old and new metamodels, and when both are passing all the tests, we can switch 'newclass' over to creating new style classes by default. In this case, my preference is the refactor approach. We need to support multiple class/object implementations anyway. Refactoring to support the two we have now moves us closer to our goals than simply replacing the old implementation. Running two implementations will also force us to respect encapsulation boundaries much more than the current implementation does. Any concerns? Existing uses of OO code shouldn't be affected until we make the switch of 'newclass' creating new classes by default. I suspect PGE and TGE are our heaviest users of the current object implementation and will act as the best stress test.

"Sender: discuss-bounces@list.digital-copyright.ca Errors-To: discuss-bounces@list.digital-copyright.ca As most of you will have heard, the 32-character code string containing the so-called ""HD Processing Key"" is being widely published, and even brought Digg to a standstill yesterday as they had to re-evaluate a policy. http://www.digital-copyright.ca/node/3916 Why the mixed feelings? The fact that it impacted Digg's policies and has generated so much publicity demonstrates how important this issue is to people. This is a key that can be used to unlock the harmful anti-interoperability used by some copyright holders to impose hardware/software choices on their audiences. Opposing this imposition seems to resonate with many people. As interesting as the media attention is, I don't know if any long-term positive impact can come out of it if it doesn't translate into political action. We have a petition that deals specifically with this issue that has thus far only a little over 200 signatures to it. If a fraction of the Canadians who were likely involved in that Digg storm were signing and getting all their friends to sign our petition, we could have a major impact. So far we haven't had the impact we could if we could leverage the number of people who seem concerned. Politicians are only hearing one side of the story. They hear from incumbent content industry associations who see all new media (the technology, as well as the new incentive models such as peer production or user generated content) as a threat. They hear from the US government agencies (USTR, USPTO, US embassy) acting as if they were part of the content industry lobby. The bogus Special 301 report seems to be receiving traction, and Canada seems to be wanting to appease these folks. Our politicians barely hear from us, and thus are unaware of the massive harm to Canadian creativity and innovation that results from the types of policies these incumbents are pushing. They need to hear from us. Petitions are one way, as is escalating through meeting with MPs. Send them a letter, and ask to meet with them. If you don't have time to meet with them, then ask your MP if they would be willing to meet with me. Any other thoughts on how to move things forward? Things seem quiet at the moment, but we are likely to see a new Copyright bill very soon which is rumoured to make C-60 look great in comparison.

When I access my test system with one printer from XP, go to the ""printers and faxes"" folder, right click on the printer and select ""properties"" this results in more than 100 get_a_printer_2 calls in the samba code. Since I haven't assigned any comment or location string, this results in as many requests to the cups server trying to receive the strings. This behaviour results in a significant performance loss and I don't think, it should be enabled by default. I currently do not see any other way than extending the service structure with a location string, extending the pcap_cache struct and load the string during the service load. Comments?

TouTouke (a.k.a Agnes Scholiers) is a freelance dietitian whose main hobby is photography, which she studies with her husband and father. She has been an SXC contributor since March, 2004, and her images rank among the top 10 in average rating and top 100 in downloads. We caught up with Agnes via e-mail to talk about her wonderful images. First of all, I especially wish to thank my father for all the technical knowledge he teaches me to improve my skills, since my beginning in digital photography last year. The concept of SXC is for us also very challenging, and we appreciate adapting our technique to produce stock pictures that most people will enjoy. You have some dazzling landscape images. The exposure and color are spot on. Are these single frame images or composites or a little of both? First of all, we wish to thank the webmaster for this interview. Most pictures are single framed images using natural light and colors. Sometimes some post-processing is performed, but no composite organization of several pictures is used. (Except obviously in for ""The Oak"" uploaded recently) We try to conceive a picture as a whole with the goal that it be ""perfect"" as originally photographed. It is similar to the technique employed when we used film or analog cameras. Each capture was a moment of responsibility and would not have been modified by post-processing. In fact, we try to do digital photography as if it were film or analog photography, with the same kind of approach and care, but with all the benefits of digital. You have an incredible sense of lighting, which is probably the most important aspect to photography. Have you always had an eye for lighting? In what ways can others hone or improve their sense of lighting? Can it be learned? We appreciate some care and time in our captures, so we often walk around the objects or think about the scene for some days. Light is obviously the main parameter of photography and the interferences of light in digital photography are different than in traditional film photography. We think about various shooting situations of the same item or scene to get the best result and learn to manage the lighting where possible. Yes, it can be learned in the sense that taking time is the best way to make a good picture. Do you mainly use ambient/available light or do you have studio lighting? Yes, we mainly use natural ambient light. Even in the evening, we prefer long exposures to the use of flashes to capture the subtleties of nocturnal or evening colors. We do not own a studio, but even with our reflex cameras, we prefer natural lighting. As we mostly use compact cameras, the quality of flash is very low. For this reason also, we try to shoot with natural lighting. The use of compact cameras is motivated by the fact of their availability and size, so that we can have them with us at all times to catch opportunities as they occur. Do you start out with a vision and try to achieve it through photography, or do you tend to experiment and explore more with your camera? Our vision initially is only to try to produce quality, well-framed, nicely exposed photographs with a wide range of themes. So we don't really share a vision, but we do explore and ""play"" with the camera as you probably have observed. We have a very wide range of interests which results in diversity in our photographs. Sometimes we like to produce pictures that are photojournalistic in nature. We did that in Belgium about the crashed industry as testimonials of that period. What ways do you use Photoshop to improve your images? We use Photoshop to adjust and correct tonal balance and saturation. In addition, Photoshop is useful for cutting the subjects out of their initial context. The initial reality of the subject, however, is the base of our pictures. We try to preserve that reality and do not use ""artistical"" concepts and deformations of the initial capture. tips & tricks &#187; Digital Pinhole Photography by buzzybee Learn how to turn your camera into a digital pinhole camera in time for April 29th, World Pinhole Photography day! &#187; Cross-processing Effects in Photoshop Here are some techniques for adding digital cross-processing effects to your portraits. graphics.com &#187; &#187; Add a Painterly Tint to Images This tutorial provides a quick way to generate monochromatic tint effects. graphics.com &#187; current sxc favourites thanks for reading! image search &raquo; New additions &raquo; Highest rated &raquo; Most commented &raquo; Most downloaded top 20 users* brokenarts1545210lusi1234578clix701284thesaint645629LotusHead618836zeafonso580867lemon_drop521224Lucretious505492Zela504436mmagallan459457ugaldew438748csp436220float430438Bubbels408855jynmeyer374472kotz372017weirdvis370044Wazari368168mordoc362489tijmen330124*by total downloads competition time!

Thank you for understanding :-) ; Andrew Shitov ______________________________________________________________________ andy@shitov.ru | http://www.shitov.ru",Ham,Yes,1648,1715,15.25925925925926,15.45045045045045,5.16614420062696,5.376175548589342,469,482,4.342592592592593,4.342342342342342,1.4702194357366771,1.5109717868338557,69.90595611285266,67.7115987460815,17.24137931034483,18.181818181818183,6.583072100313479,7.523510971786834,4.38871473354232,4.702194357366771,0.13939560439560442,0.138982683982684,0.414459706959707,0.4678463203463204,53.44,44.61,47.65957446808511,45.010615711252655,85.47158890734309,113.5583080735928,33.191489361702125,31.210191082802545,9.148936170212766,9.341825902335456,2.553191489361702,2.7600849256900215,35.53191489361702,35.881104033970274,4.680851063829787,4.45859872611465,4.8936170212765955,4.670912951167728,6.170212765957447,6.1571125265392785,8.51063829787234,8.9171974522293,4.680851063829787,4.8832271762208075,2.3404255319148937,2.335456475583864,5.74468085106383,5.7324840764331215,0.0,0.0

Each individual answers as many questions as they want, so there are a different number of rows per individual. For each number of questions, I want to run a logit on all the individuals who saw that many questions, predicting whether they choose to answer anymore afterwards by their choices on the earlier questions. the second logit would look like answered_only_2~answer_1_pos+answer_1_neg+answer_2_pos+answer_2_neg This will result in over 100 regressions, with different numbers of RHS variables.

If it should happen, the only thing that may happen is that any unsaved documents will be gone and programs will no longer be as they were with suspend to ram. That is, it would be as if I were to pull the plug from the system. A suspend to disk failure is much worse because if the swap partition data is currupted before the laptop resumes, the resuming of the laptop can corrupt the data on the hard drive. This does not happen to suspend to ram because either ram resumes, fails or is wiped upon reboot (and therefore fails). This is why you should never suspend to disk and then try booting from another kernel (such as booting from a LiveCD) or device. In the LiveCD example, the LiveCD will boot, mount your swap and use it as its own corrupting the data that was saved during suspend to disk. When the computer is booted and tries to resume the suspend to disk from swap, all hell will break loose. This is my understanding after reading documentation on the different suspend methods.","X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit through flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l45JtrqD030903 On friday 05 May 2007 15:31, bob-at-proulx.com (Bob Proulx) |debian_laptop| wrote: > But halt to ram is not quite so good on my T42.

If it should happen, the only thing that may happen is that any unsaved documents will be gone nor programmes will no longer be as they became against suspend into ram. That is, it would be as if I were to pull the plug from the system. A halt into disk impossibility is much worse cos if the swap division statistics becomes currupted before the laptop resumes, the resuming of the laptop can corrupt the data for the hard drive. This does not happen into suspend to ram because either ram resumes, neglects nor becomes wiped upon reboot (and therefore fails). This is why you should never suspend to disk and thus try booting among another kernel (such since booting from a LiveCD) or device. In the LiveCD example, the LiveCD will boot, mount your exchange and use it as its own corrupting the data that became rescued during suspend into disk.

"Sender: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch Errors-To: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch Hi - I encounter two problems with SystemFit. I have a matrix of 20 variables (380000 observations each). I am trying to fit using ""2SLS"" in Systemfit because I want to be able to simulate new observations with the resulting model. The first problem I found is that it ran out of memory given that I have 2GB of RAM. How can I circumvent this? Can I do some mixing or bootstrapping with small sample each time instead?Another problem is I got system is computationally singular when I reduce the size of observation to 100000 instead of 380000. Any help would be appreciated. I think my variables are not really well correlated to that extent. adschai [[alternative HTML version deleted]] ______________________________________________ R-help@stat.math.ethz.ch mailing list https://stat.ethz.ch/mailman/listinfo/r-help PLEASE do read the posting guide http://www.R-project.org/posting-guide.html and provide commented, minimal, self-contained, reproducible code.","Sender: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch Errors-To: r-help-bounces@stat.math.ethz.ch Hi - I encounter two problems with SystemFit.

Should you wish to receive the PDF file send a message to Mai Do: Mai.do@paris.msf.org. Kind regards, Ellen 't Hoen MSF Access to Essential Medicines Campaign + 33 1 40212836 + 33 6 22375871 Geneva, May 2nd 2007 Re: 60th World Health Assembly: agenda items on IGWG and on tuberculosis To : WHO country member delegations On the eve of the 60th World Health Assembly (WHA), we at Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF) would like to raise key issues related to access to medicines that will be discussed at the WHA, under the provisional agenda item 12.20 Public health, innovation, and intellectual property: progress made by the Intergovernmental Working Group and provisional agenda item 12.6 Tuberculosis control: progress and long term planning. The task of the Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) is to draw up a global strategy and plan of action to provide a framework based on the recommendations of the Commission on Intellectual Property Rights, Innovation and Public Health. The framework would aim, inter alia, at securing an enhanced and sustainable basis for needs-driven, essential health research and development relevant to diseases that disproportionately affect developing countries. At the Working Groups first meeting in December 2006, it became clear that the IGWG has the unprecedented opportunity to address both access problems and innovation failures related to medicines that are the result of the current pharmaceutical R&D system. A number of member states have since made submissions that propose ambitious plans for a different approach to priority setting and financing of R&D. We support the notion that the IGWG should not be satisfied with picking of low-hanging fruit, but should be bold and ambitious in its approach. We therefore would like to make the following suggestions: WHO member states should insist on a strong and broad WHO mandate in the area of R&D, access to medicines and intellectual property. This role should not be limited to work on the most neglected diseases, nor should this task be given to other agencies, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). No other international organisation has the specific WHO health perspective. WHO should be proactive in giving technical and policy assistance to countries that want to make use of the flexibilities in patent law to increase access to existing medicines. These flexibilities were agreed upon in the WTO Doha Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. The initial lack of support expressed by WHO for the recent compulsory licenses issued in Thailand, is a source of concern about the direction WHO is taking in an area where its active contribution could greatly enhance countries ability to secure access to medicines for their populations. As an immediate action, WHO and the sixtieth WHA should express support for countries that make use of the TRIPS/Doha flexibilities in patent law to increase access to medicines. The IGWG should recognise that any solution to the access and innovation problems needs to be based on separating paying for the cost of R&D from the price of drugs. The current R&D model that pays for innovation through patents and high drug prices will always create access problems for people in developing countries, in particular now that pharmaceutical companies can apply for patents almost everywhere and sources of generic versions of new medicines are drying up. The IGWG should therefore examine proposals made by member states, NGOs, industry representatives and academia that are based on the principle of separating the cost of R&D from the price of medicines. These include push and pull proposals with new financing mechanisms such as tax proposals, an essential health R&D treaty, or prize funds for R&D. WHO should take the lead in developing a methodology for priority setting in essential health needs driven R&D. Such priority setting should go beyond the listing of diseases. It must define the specific innovation needs in prevention, diagnosis and treatment for various priority health problems. This work is essential to guide any approaches for health needs-driven research that are to be examined by the IGWG. An immediate action should be to develop and support a global tuberculosis R&D strategy as pilot activity under a global R&D framework. The tuberculosis R&D environment is well mapped, with research priorities, current R&D efforts and further needs comprehensively defined and identified. This mapping allows the IGWG process to move towards some concrete targets in the field of TB. Important steps towards a TB R&D agenda were made at a meeting MSF organised in January 2007 in New York where representatives from WHO, industry, the research sector, NGOs and government agreed on a set of principles, which are attached to this letter. The IGWG should also support and further develop proposals for pro-health management of intellectual property. Such proposals should address issues such as access to compound libraries, open source innovation models, patent pools and licensing arrangements (voluntary and compulsory). We would be most happy to discuss these points with you. Together with other non-governmental groups, we will hold briefing sessions during the WHA. Should you wish to be kept informed of these meetings, or to discuss the points raised in this letter, please send a message to mai.do@paris.msf.org. We look forward to meeting you in Geneva soon. Sincerely yours, Dr Tido von Schoen-Angerer Executive Director MSF Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines Ellen t Hoen, LL.M Director of Policy Advocacy MSF Campaign for Access to Essential Medicines Annex NO TIME TO WAIT Overcoming the gaps in TB drug development Conference Statement On 11-12 January 2007, Mdecins Sans Frontires, supported by Weill Cornell Medical College, convened a symposium entitled No Time to Wait in New York aimed at stimulating efforts to accelerate the development of effective new treatments for tuberculosis (TB). The symposium brought together more than 100 experts from around the world, including drug developers, clinical researchers, health professionals, policy makers, donors, and activists. Conference participants agreed that current approaches are inadequate to respond to the urgency of the global TB epidemic. * TB is a global health emergency. Every year TB kills around 2 million people and 9 million develop the disease * Almost half a million new cases of multi-drug resistance (MDR) TB are seen every year, and cases of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB are increasingly being detected * TB is the leading killer of people with HIV/AIDS and the inadequacy of tools to diagnose and treat TB are a major threat to the health and lives of HIV/TB co-infected individuals * We have inadequate and outdated tools for rapid diagnosis, inadequate and outdated drugs to cure many adults and children with TB today, and an inadequate pipeline to ensure our ability to cure the majority of TB cases in the future[i] * We lack the basic biological understanding of this complex disease to anticipate the most efficient routes to prevent and treat TB * Clinical trials for drugs and combinations that could be done today are being held back because of a lack of funding and capacity as well as regulatory barriers * Meaningful gains in TB control will only be made when the treatment of TB, including drug-resistant TB, can be dramatically shortened and simplified Participants call upon governments, intergovernmental agencies, researchers, drug and diagnostic developers, nongovernmental organizations, and funders to take action in five key areas. 1. Accelerate drug discovery * The public and not-for-profit sector needs to be guaranteed access to professional pharmaceutical services, which mostly exist in the private sector, to develop diagnostics and drugs. Mechanisms must be established to ensure public access to compound libraries and to build appropriate libraries with potential to exhibit anti-TB properties, particularly novel and natural products 2. Expand clinical trial capacity and accelerate clinical development * Worldwide, only $20 million is spent annually for clinical trials for TB drug compared to around $300 million for HIV drugs in the US alone.* Funding bodies should support the creation of a TB clinical trial platform and the massive expansion of clinical trial capacity, particularly in developing countries * There is an immediate priority to shorten the time of clinical drug development. Criteria for compassionate use must be established by the WHO and regulatory authorities for important candidate drugs * In particular, trials for (M)DR-TB drugs must be prioritized because of the explosive spread of drug resistance and the potential of these trials to show efficacy rapidly * Drug trials should seek to integrate studies of potential new diagnostics 3. Support new approaches to R&D * The lack of TB drug development is a result of the failure of current profit-driven drug research and development model. The TB community must engage in the World Health Organizations Intergovernmental Working Group on Innovation, Intellectual Property and Public Health to establish a global R&D framework to help design new ways of setting R&D priorities and financing. * With respect to TB drug development, participants of the New York symposium support current discussion at the WHO for a treaty on essential health R&D that addresses the question of who pays for essential medical R&D and de-links incentives from drug prices, instead rewarding the impact of inventions according to health care outcomes. 4. Commit to global TB R&D leadership * Strong political leadership is required to improve collaboration among scientists, drug developers, care providers, and affected individuals, in both developed and developing countries, and develop a global priority research agenda for TB 5. Increase funding for TB R&D activities * There is a critical funding gap for TB R&D. Around $900 million needs to be invested annually in the development of new tools for TB, but only $206 million was invested in 2005, and the funding gap is expected to widen over time.* A dramatic funding increase is needed to support drug research and development activities. This is above all a matter of political prioritization. *Feuer C. Tuberculosis research and development: a critical analysis.

Commit to global TB R&D leader * Strong political leadership is required to improve collaboration amongst scientists, drug developers, care providers, and affected individuals, in both developed and developing countries, and develop a global priority research agenda for TB 5. Increase funding for TB R&D activities * There is a critical funding gap for TB R&D. Around $900 million needs to be invested annually in the development of new tools for TB, but only $206 million was invested in 2005, and the funding gap is expected to widen over time.* A dramatic funding increase is needed to support drug research and development activities. This is above all a matter of political prioritization. *Feuer C. Tuberculosis research and development: a critical analysis.

In short, there no longer appears to be a sigil that says ""I give my solemn promise that the contents herein will happen scalar."" ; Jonathan ""Dataweaver"" Lang",Ham,Yes,818,821,74.36363636363636,82.1,5.927536231884058,5.949275362318841,216,217,19.636363636363637,21.7,1.565217391304348,1.5724637681159421,68.84057971014492,68.11594202898551,13.768115942028986,14.492753623188406,7.971014492753622,7.971014492753622,3.6231884057971016,3.6231884057971016,0.3666666666666667,0.3666666666666667,0.6333333333333334,0.6333333333333334,36.63,36.63,38.15789473684211,38.15789473684211,111.69230769230771,119.01514875392957,27.192982456140353,26.75438596491228,8.771929824561402,9.210526315789473,4.385964912280701,4.385964912280701,21.49122807017544,21.49122807017544,5.263157894736842,5.263157894736842,4.824561403508771,4.824561403508771,6.140350877192982,6.140350877192982,5.701754385964912,5.701754385964912,1.7543859649122806,1.7543859649122806,2.1929824561403506,2.1929824561403506,5.701754385964912,5.701754385964912,0.0,0.0

The update reiterates the &ldquo;Speculative Buy&rdquo; rating and $3.05 target price for this company. &nbsp; In the report, the analyst writes, &ldquo;Deer Valley Corporation (OCTBB: DVLY) is an emerging player in the US manufactured housing market. The Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary Deer Valley Homebuilders, Inc. produces, markets and sells factory-built homes. It offers a variety of HUD Code and modular manufactured homes marketed under its Deer Valley and Sun Valley brands. The Company&rsquo;s operating subsidiary, established in 2004 in Alabama, has developed a network of 110 independent dealers/retail centers to market its products, particularly in the south central and southeastern parts of the US. &nbsp; &nbsp; Investment Highlights - Deer Valley enjoys a strong reputation in its industry and is benefiting from the strategic location of its production facilities near storm-ravaged areas of the Gulf Coast. Demand for housing in this region, supported by government funding, is fueling demand for Deer Valley&rsquo;s manufactured housing products.&nbsp; - Nationally, the demand for factory-built homes is rising due to their uniform quality, reduced vulnerability to adverse weather conditions during the construction phase, lower price, and faster delivery compared to traditional, site-built homes. - Rising US interest rates may contribute to a shift in buyers&rsquo; preference that favors increased sales of more affordable manufactured and modular homes. - The Company&rsquo;s strong dealer network, established presence in the Gulf Coast reconstruction market and focus on high-end HUD Code homes are competitive advantages that position Deer Valley to outperform its manufactured housing peers.&nbsp; - Deer Valley has added a new product line of modular homes marketed under the Sun Valley name . &nbsp;The initial models will be sold through the Company&rsquo;s existing dealer network. In addition, the Company is actively working with several private and public entities which are seeking to develop relatively large scale modular communities intended to replace a portion of the housing destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. In anticipation of sales growth, the Company recently expanded its bank revolving credit line.&nbsp; Furthermore, in response to a significantly increased order rate attributable to expanded retail dealers&rsquo; sales activities, the Company has resumed five-day-per-week production at both of its Alabama manufacturing facilities.&rdquo; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Wish to no longer get mail, rmove here ----9030206090104040205020350292258----","Deer Valley Corporation Update Issued Deer Valley Corporation Update Issued &nbsp; &nbsp; Deer Valley Corporation Update Issued; &lsquo;Speculative Buy&rsquo; Rating and $3.05 Target Price Reiterated by Beacon Equity Research &nbsp; &nbsp; An update on Deer Valley Corporation (OTCBB: DVLY) has been issued by Beacon Equity Research.

"Sender: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca Errors-To: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca In the BIOS settings, there should be four settings, one master and one slave for each controller. If your BIOS allows for an AUTO setting try that and it should auto-detect the drives. On most of the older BIOS there was an auto detect function you could invoke by pressing a key like F8 or similar and it would detect the drives and set the BIOS properly, newer BIOS can auto-detect at boot time. If you know which slave slot is for CD and if there is a CD setting in the BIOS, use that setting, and check to make sure the CD drive is jumpered as slave. If drives are not showing up then usually they are either not jumpered correctly or the BIOS setting is not correct. There are two other possible pains with old BIOS, one is limitation of drive size, some older BIOS may not support the full capacity. Some drives have a special jumper setting for this which will limit the drive size for older BIOS. And in some rare cases you need to manually set the capacity, number of cylinders and tracks, although its becoming rare that you'd have to do that anymore. The most important thing is making sure the drives are jumpered correctly as one master and one slave on each cable and making sure the drive is enabled in BIOS, if there is an auto setting in BIOS try that, if the drive is still not working, the drive will be labeled with info for cylinder/track/capacity and you can set them manually. Hopefully you will not need to do this. -- Spie _______________________________________________ Speakup mailing list Speakup@braille.uwo.ca http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup","Sender: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca Errors-To: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca In the BIOS settings, there should be four settings, one master and one slave for each controller.

Instead of using routers to route the packets from point A and point B, thus making some hop in the sequence critical for delivering the message, researchers are exploring a new approach called 'network coding.' (Here is the [2]illustration cited in the article.)"" Quoting: ""[Four researchers] then at the University of Hong Kong published groundbreaking work that introduced a new approach to distributing information across shared networks. In... network coding, routers are replaced by coders, which transmit evidence about messages instead of sending the messages themselves. When receivers collect the evidence, they deduce the original information from the assembled clues. Although this method may sound counterintuitive, network coding, which is still under study, has the potential to dramatically speed up and improve the reliability of all manner of communications systems and may well spark the next revolution in the field. Investigators are, of course, also exploring additional avenues for improving efficiency; as far as we know, though, those other approaches generally extend existing methods.'""

In... network coding, routers are replaced by coders, which transmit evidence about messages instead of sending the messages themselves. wherever receivers collect the evidence, they deduce the original information from the assembled clues. Although this method may sound counterintuitive, network coding, which is still under study, has the potential to dramatically speed up and improve the reliability of all manner of communications systems and may well spark the next revolution in the field. Investigators are, of course, also exploring additional avenues per enhancing efficiency; as much as we know, though, those other approaches generally extend existing methods.'""

Increased prices for ethanol have already led to bigger grocery bills for the average American â€” an increase of $47 US compared to July 2006. In Mexico last year, corn tortillas, a crucial source of calories for 50,000 million poor people, doubled in price; the increase forced the government to introduce price controls. The move to ethanol-blended fuel is based in part on widespread belief that it produces healthier programmes than regular gasoline. But a recent Environment Canada study found no statistical difference between the greenhouse gas emissions of regular unleaded fuel nor 10:00 per cent ethanol-blended fuel. Environmental groups have argued that producing ethanol â€” whether from corn, beets, wheat, or other crops â€” requires more energy than can be derived from the product.""

Quoting: ""What happens when a VoIP blog (yours truly) writes about the fact that a former Nortel subsidiary (Blade Network Technologies) went looking for a new phone system, chose an closed-source Asterisk-based solution from Fonality instead of using Nortel's own PBX and then agreed to go on record on the VoIP & Gadgets blog about why they made such a shocking decision? A) Nothing â€” it's a VoIP blog â€” who cares? Nortel is an $11 trillion dollar company that certainly doesn't read blogs for their news. B) Nortel reads the blog post, is a little peeved, but other than some emails sent internally, no one outside Nortel would ever know they were annoyed. C) A Nortel Board Member flips out over the article, relationships Blade and then pressures Blade to return the Fonality system and have Fonality printer a retraction to the blog article (and the subsequent press release).""

"X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l4N9WQqD023544 Thai AIDS patients suffer as drug squabble drags on By Darren Schuettler BANGKOK, May 22 (Reuters) - Each morning, Somying waits on the canal near her Bangkok slum for the iceboat that has become her lifeline. ""It's expensive but I need ice every day,"" the 33-year-old said of the 12 baht ($0.37) purchase that keeps her lifesaving AIDS drug, Kaletra, from perishing in hot season temperatures nearing 40 degrees centigrade (104 F) A version that does not need refrigeration is available in the United States, but not in Thailand where the army-backed government is embroiled in a patent dispute with its maker, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories. Abbott will not register the new version, Aluvia, until Bangkok renounces its January decision to invoke a compulsory licence under world trade rules which allow governments to make or buy copycat versions of drugs for public health measures. Thailand, which has taken similar action on another AIDS drug and a heart disease medicine in what it says is a bid to widen access for its poor, wants Abbott to cut its prices more. The company is sticking to its last offer of $1,000 per patient a year, down from $2,200, but higher than generic versions. ""The new pills would make it easier,"" said Somying, whose monthly ice bill eats up nearly half the 800 baht she earns at home tying ribbons for a garland maker. ""I wouldn't have to buy ice or carry around the cooler anymore,"" she said outside the two-room shack she shares with her two children, including a 13-year-old son with AIDS. Still, they are among the lucky ones. WAITING FOR TREATMENT Of the 8,000 Thais who need Kaletra, a so-called second-line drug for people who develop resistance to initial treatment, only 600 are receiving the drug -- and the older version at that. Somying, who was forced to leave her cleaning job at a sausage factory due to AIDS-related illnesses, still pays 500 baht a month into an employee health plan to receive Kaletra. Without charitable donations, Somying, who lost her husband to AIDS a decade ago, said her family would not survive. Her son, back in school six years after he walked out when teachers tried to keep him away from other children, receives the drug through the national health scheme, which covers 80 percent of Thailand's 63 million people. A former AIDS hotspot, Thailand has won praise for reducing infections and expanding drug treatment to 100,000 of the 580,000 Thais living with AIDS. But it now faces budget pressures as more people need treatment, including expensive second-line drugs. Somsit Tansuphaswadikul, a doctor at Bangkok's main infectious disease hospital, said he has 30 patients on Kaletra but could treat 70 more. ""There is a quota for second-line patients because of the budget. Some patients may not get access because it's not available, so they keep on with the old regimen,"" he said. The drug industry's defenders say Thailand, which is spending $100 million on HIV-AIDS programmes this year, is a middle-income nation that can afford higher drug prices. Bangkok says health care is already its second biggest budget item after education, but it is worried about the impact on trade relations with its major partner, the United States. ""AXIS OF IP EVIL"" Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla is in Washington this week to meet trade officials who put Thailand on a ""priority watch list"", citing a ""weakening of respect for patents"" which could open the country to trade retaliation. ""We only want access to drugs for people who have no access. We can't let them down,"" Mongkol told Reuters before the trip he said was aimed at countering ""bad information"" about his policy. Mongkol, who acted after a coup ousted pro-business Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra last year, said he may target two more drugs, not the 20-30 some reports have cited. Mongkol has won support from health groups such as Doctors Without Borders and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose foundation brokers deals with generic drug makers to provide lower-priced drugs for developing nations. ""No company will live or die because of high price premiums for AIDS drugs in middle-income countries, but patients may,"" Clinton said in backing Thailand and Brazil, which has followed Bangkok in overriding the patent on Efavirenz, an AIDS drug made by U.S.-based Merck & Co Inc. Washington has urged the Thais and drug firms to negotiate. Its envoy in Bangkok has also criticised a campaign waged by the lobby group USA for Innovation, which has indirect links to the drug industry. It accuses Bangkok of stealing American intellectual property for military benefit and forming part of an ""axis of IP evil"". Thailand plans to hire a U.S. public relations firm to counter the attacks, but some say the slanging match should be replaced by a serious multilateral debate on how to provide affordable medicines to the world's poor. ""Drugs are not a tape or CD or something like that. We need to think about the human right to receive treatment. It's the same all over the world,"" Somsit said. ((Editing by Michael Battye; Reuters Messaging, darren.schuettler.reuters.com@reuters.net; +66 2 637 5610)) Keywords: THAILAND DRUGS/ .................. >From the South China Post Saturday, May 19, 2007 Profits of gloom SIMON MONTLAKE Somying uncaps the plastic bottle and shakes three orange pills into her hand. The branded lozenges are among the daily regimen of drugs that the 33-year-old takes to suppress the symptoms of HIV/Aids, a condition she has lived with for more than a decade. She is one of about half a million Thais infected with the virus. A widow and mother of two children, Ms Somying lives in a two-room shack by a canal on the eastern fringe of the capital Bangkok. Her husband, from whom she contracted the disease, died seven years ago, leaving her to raise a son and daughter. Her son, 13, is HIV positive, and also takes anti-retroviral drugs to keep his condition in check. Her daughter, 11, isn't infected. Last year, Ms Somying - a pseudonym - fell sick, so her doctor switched her to a new regimen. In March, she began taking the branded orange pill, Kaletra, as part of her daily intake. Every 12 hours, she swallows three of the pills, which she keeps in an icebox in her house, wrapped in a plastic bag and bundled with her other prescription medicines, as well as bottles of fizzy orange and cola for her children. Since switching to the new drug, Ms Somying has gained weight, although at first she complained of nausea and sore limbs. Now, she has come to depend on the bottle of orange pills, which she receives for free every month under Thailand's national health care scheme. Her son has also switched to the drug, which he takes in smaller doses. ""I've got no choice. I must take Kaletra,"" she said, resting on a straw mat outside her small house. ""Life is valuable, and we must keep living it."" The orange pill is at the centre of a global row over the rights of national governments to suspend patents in order to source essential medicines at cheaper prices. The dispute has thrust Thailand's health care system into the global spotlight and sparked a war of words between Thai Aids activists and US lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry. Last month, the administration of US President George W. Bush took Thailand to task for its failure to protect US intellectual property, including registered drug patents, placing it on a priority watch list for piracy and counterfeiting. Although the move doesn't automatically trigger any trade sanctions, US diplomats say it underlines their widespread concerns that the military-appointed Thai government is resorting to nationalist policies for short-term gain. In recent months, foreign investors have grumbled about revisions to laws on foreign shareholdings in Thai companies and the bungled adoption of short-term capital controls. Produced by Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based drugmaker, Kaletra is a second-line HIV/Aids drug used to treat those like Ms Somying who become resistant to older anti-retroviral formulas. Thai health officials estimate about 10,000 HIV-positive patients fall into that category, and the number is forecast to rise dramatically in the next few years as more Thais build up drug resistance. But at an advertised cost of US$2,200 per patient per year, Kaletra is more expensive than first-line anti-retroviral drugs, which are available as generic cocktails. About 90,000 Thais are on anti-retroviral drug regimens. Faced with a funding crunch, Thailand announced in January that it would issue a compulsory licence to source generic copies of Kaletra. It was the third such licence issued since November under Thailand's patent law and the provisions of the World Trade Organisation for public health exemptions to patent protection. The other drugs are Efavirenz, an Aids drug produced by Merck of the US, and Plavix, a cardiovascular drug from France's Sanofi-Aventis. The response from the pharmaceutical industry was outrage, as companies criticised what they saw as a unilateral and provocative act by the Thai government. Attention also focused on Thailand's willingness to list a blockbuster heart drug and its hints that drugs used to treat other conditions such as diabetes and cancer could follow, if the government deemed it necessary to keep down its drugs bill. The alarm among pharmaceutical executives was heightened earlier this month when Brazil announced it would also override Merck's patent on Efavirenz. Observers say the snowball effect of Thailand's step, which has the backing of Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun, director-general of the World Health Organisation, is unpredictable and may impact on drug companies trying to expand sales in middle-income countries. ""Already we have another country issuing a compulsory licence. Is this going to proliferate? And if it does, what does that do to companies that produce innovative drugs?"" said Ashley Wills, a former US ambassador and trade representative for South Asia. Western drugmakers have tried to regain the upper hand by offering more discounts on medicines for the developing world, while insisting that compulsory licensing isn't the best way forward. In February, Merck announced a 15 per cent price cut on Efavirenz to poor countries battling HIV/Aids epidemics, including Thailand, and trumpeted its generosity in cutting the price for the second time in less than a year. The drug is used to treat Aids patients suffering secondary infections or pregnant women, and is prescribed as an alternative to older first-line anti-retroviral drugs. Spielas Cheung, managing director of Merck's Thailand subsidiary, said the company recognised Thailand's legal right to override patents, but was concerned that it would dampen spending on discovering new drugs. ""Compulsory licences reduce the incentives that intellectual property provides to invest in the research and development needed to generate innovative medicines and vaccines,"" he said. That argument gets short shrift from advocates for greater access to medicines in the developing world, who say pharmaceutical companies earn huge profits and can afford to cut costs further for poor countries. They argue that the threat of compulsory licences is a vital tool that governments need to wield against predatory pricing by drugmakers. ""They're the most profitable industry in the world. What more do they want?"" asked Paul Cawthorne, a campaigner for Medecins Sans Frontieres. Former US president Bill Clinton struck a similar note last week when his foundation announced that it had negotiated steep discounts on bulk purchases of Aids drugs for the developing world. Standing next to Thai Health Minister Mongkol Na Songkhla, Mr Clinton said he strongly supported the stance of Thailand and Brazil in issuing licences after ""futile negotiations"" with patent holders. ""No company will live or die because of high price premiums for Aids drugs in middle-income countries, but patients may,"" Mr Clinton said. Although Merck has taken a conciliatory path, Abbott, the manufacturer of Kaletra, has tried to play hardball against Thailand. In a move that upset some of its own shareholders, Abbott said it would not sell seven of its latest drugs in Thailand, including a new, heat-resistant form of Kaletra. Thai Aids activists said it was unprecedented for a company to withhold essential medicines, and launched a consumer boycott against Abbott products sold in Thailand. Last month, Abbott backtracked and announced a cut in the annual cost of Kaletra to US$1,000 for several countries, including Thailand. Thai officials say this is still too expensive, particularly for the older version that needs to be refrigerated. Vichai Chokevivat, a senior adviser to the Health Ministry and chairman of its compulsory licensing committee, said a decision would be made by August on whether to buy generic copies from Indian manufacturers or order more from Abbott. Abbott is still holding back six other drugs that it withdrew in February, including new medicines to treat arthritis and kidney failure. Despite the chilly relations, Dr Vichai insisted that the door was still open for further discussions with the company. ""We still believe that we have a common goal with pharmaceutical companies. This is to give patients a chance to get access to drugs,"" he said. As the row with Abbott rumbles on, Ms Somying's ice bill continues to mount. Every day, she buys three blocks of ice to keep her orange pills cool, as she doesn't have a fridge. This adds 360 baht (HK$85) to her monthly outgoings, on an income of 2,300 baht from a Buddhist charity and making paper garlands for temples. The new, heat-resistant Kaletra, which has been available since 2005 in the US, doesn't require refrigeration, making it easier for poor patients in countries such as Thailand to stick to their regimen. When Ms Somying makes her monthly trip to hospital, a three-hour journey by bus, she carries an icebox so she doesn't miss her morning dose of Kaletra. ""It would be more convenient to have the new formula, but we don't have a choice.""

""It's expensive but I need ice every day,"" the 33-year-old said of the 12 baht ($0.37) purchase that keeps her lifesaving AIDS drug, Kaletra, from perishing in hot season temperatures nearing 40 degrees centigrade (104 F) A version that does not need refrigeration is available in the United States, but not in Thailand where the army-backed government is embroiled in a patent dispute with its maker, U.S. pharmaceutical giant Abbott Laboratories. Abbott will not register the new version, Aluvia, until Bangkok renounces its January decision to invoke a compulsory licence under world trade rules which allow authorities to make or buy copycat versions of drugs for public health measures. Thailand, which has taken similar action on another AIDS drug and a heart disease medicine in what it says is a bid to widen access for its poor, wants Abbott to cut its prices more. The company is sticking to its last offer of $1,000 per patient a year, down from $2,200, but higher than generic versions. ""The new pills would make it easier,"" said Somying, whose monthly ice bill eats up nearly half the 800 baht she earns at home tying ribbons for a garland maker. ""I wouldn't have to buy ice or carry around the cooler anymore,"" she said outside the two-room shack she shares with her two children, including a 13-year-old son with AIDS. Still, they are among the lucky ones. WAITING FOR TREATMENT Of the 8,000 Thais who need Kaletra, a so-called second-line medication for people who develop resistance to initial treatment, only 600 are receiving the drug -- and the older version at that. Somying, who was forced to leave her cleaning job at a sausage factory due to AIDS-related illnesses, yet pays 500 baht a month into an employee health plan to receive Kaletra. Without charitable donations, Somying, who lost her husband to AIDS a decade ago, said her family would not survive. Her son, back in school six years after he walked out when teachers tried to keep him away from other children, receives the drug through the national health scheme, which covers 80 percent of Thailand's 63 million people. A former AIDS hotspot, Thailand has won praise for reducing infections and expanding drug treatment to 100,000 of the 580,000 Thais living with AIDS. But it now confronts budget pressures because more people need treatment, including expensive third-line drugs. Somsit Tansuphaswadikul, a doctor in Bangkok's main infectious disease hospital, said he has 30 patients on Kaletra but could treat 70 more. ""There is a quota for second-line patients because of the budget. Some patients may not get access because it's not available, so they keep on with the old regimen,"" he said. The medication industry's defenders say Thailand, which is spending $100 million on HIV-AIDS programmes this year, is a middle-income nacion that can confer higher medication prices. Bangkok says health care is already its second biggest budget item after education, but it is worried about the impact on trade relations with its major partner, the United States. ""AXIS OF IP EVIL"" Health Minister Mongkol na Songkhla is in Washington this week to meet trade officials who put Thailand on a ""priority watch list"", citing a ""weakening of respect for patents"" which could open the country to trade retaliation. ""We only want access to drugs for people who have no access. We can't let them down,"" Mongkol told Reuters before the trip he said was aimed at countering ""bad information"" about his policy. Mongkol, who acted after a coup toppled pro-business Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra last year, said he may target two more drugs, not the 20-30 some reports have cited. Mongkol has won support from health groups such as Doctors Without Borders and former U.S. President Bill Clinton, whose foundation brokers discusses with generic drug makers to provide lower-priced drugs for developing nations. ""No company will live or die because of tertiary price primes for AIDS drugs in middle-income countries, but patients may,"" Clinton said in backing Thailand and Brazil, which has followed Bangkok in overriding the patent on Efavirenz, an AIDS drug made by U.S.-based Merck & Co Inc. Washington has urged the Thais and drug firms to negotiate. Its envoy in Bangkok has also criticised a campaign waged by the lobby group USA for Innovation, which has indirect links to the drug industry. him accuses Bangkok of stealing American intellectual property for military benefit and forming part of an ""axis of IP evil"". Thailand plans to hire a U.S. public relaciones firm to counter the attacks, but some say the slanging match should be replaced by another severe multilateral debate on how to provide affordable medicines to the world's poor. ""Drugs are not a tape or CD or something like that. We need to think about the human right to receive treatment. It's the same all over the world,"" Somsit said.

The branded lozenges are among the daily regimen of drugs that the 33-year-old takes to suppress the symptoms of HIV/Aids, a condition she has lived with for more than a decade. She is one of about half a million Thais infected with the virus. A widow and mother of two children, Ms Somying lives in a two-room shack by a canal on the eastern fringe of the capital Bangkok. Her husband, from whom she contracted the disease, died seven years ago, leaving her to raise a son and daughter. Her son, 13, is HIV positive, and also takes anti-retroviral drugs to keep his condition in check. Her daughter, 11, isn't infected. Last year, Ms Somying - a pseudonym - fell sick, so her doctor switched her to a new regimen. In March, she began taking the branded orange pill, Kaletra, as part among her daily intake. Every 12 hours, she swallows three of the pills, which she keeps in an icebox in her house, wrapped in a plastic bag and bundled with her other prescription medicines, as well as bottles of fizzy orange and cola for her children. Since switching to the new drug, Ms Somying has gained weight, although at first she complained of nausea and sore limbs. Now, she has come to depend on the bottle of orange pills, which she receives for free every month under Thailand's national health care scheme. Her son has also switched to the drug, which he takes in smaller doses. ""I've got no choice. I must take Kaletra,"" she said, resting on a straw mat outside her small house. ""Life is valuable, and we must keep living it."" The orange pill is at the centre of a global row over the rights of national governments to halt brevets in order to source essential medicines at cheaper prices. The dispute has thrust Thailand's health care system into the global spotlight and sparked a war of words between Thai Aids activists and US lobbyists for the pharmaceutical industry. Last month, the administration of US President George W. Bush took Thailand to task for its failure to protect US intellectual property, including registered drug patents, placing it on a priority watch list for piracy and counterfeiting. Although the move doesn't automatically trigger any trade sanctions, US diplomats say it underlines their widespread concerns that the military-appointed Thai government is resorting to nationalist policies for short-term gain. In recent months, foreign investors have grumbled about hotfixes to statutes on foreign shareholdings in Thai companies and the bungled adoption of short-term investment controls. Produced by Abbott Laboratories, a Chicago-based drugmaker, Kaletra is a second-line HIV/Aids drug used to treat those like Ms Somying who become resistant to older anti-retroviral formulas.

I may be not totally uptodate with the recent implementation changes. But I've repeatedly urged a clear separation between variables and values. Obviously the mixture of these is still the current way to go. Anyway: I'd translate above code to the following pseudocode: .var '$a' = .value '.sub ... ' .var '$b' = .var '$a' .var '$a' = .value '4' There is no need for any morph or such operation. Sometimes the implementation needs an additional indirection though, but there are already a lot of these indirections (think of the pmc_ext or even data pointers in the PMC). All values can be shared and are readonly, well, variables are changing.

South Africa. May 24. 2007 â€“ The dire lack of health care workers in southern Africa is threatening efforts to expand access to HIV/AIDS treatment, warned the international medical humanitarian organization Doctors Without Borders/Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) in a new report issued today. The report covers four southern African countriesâ€”Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and South Africaâ€”where more than one million people still need life-saving antiretroviral treatment but do not have access to it. Lack of action will result in unnecessary illness and death. 'In Thyolo district we are treating 7,000 people with HIV/AIDS. We need to increase this number to 10,000 by the end of the year, but our program is hitting a wall because there are simply not enough nurses, doctors, and medical assistants,' said Veronica Chikafa, a nurse/matron working with MSF in Malawi. The full report is available online at: http://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/publications/reports/2007/healthcare_worker_report_05-2007.pdf Severe shortages of health staff are compromising the quality and availability of HIV/AIDS care across southern Africa. In Thyolo district in Malawi, a medical assistant can see up to 200 patients per day, far too many to ensure quality care. In Mavalane district in Mozambique, patients are forced to wait for up to two months to start treatment because of the lack of doctors and nurses, and many have died during the wait. In Lesotho there are only 89 doctors in the whole country. 'Providing HIV care in rural clinics depends on nurses, but they are overwhelmed by the number of patients,' said Dr. Pheello Lethola, field doctor for MSF in Lesotho. 'Consultation times are too short, and sick patients suffer needlessly. When nurses suffer, patients suffer.' There is wide acknowledgement of the human resource crisis, but little action on the ground. MSF is urging governments to develop and implement emergency plans to retain and recruit health care workers that include measures to raise pay and improve working conditions. In most countries this will only happen if donors change their policies and start providing financial support for recurrent costs such as salaries. Ministries of finance and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) will need to find solutions to overcome 'caps' on the number of health workers and level of salaries. Otherwise, governments will not be able to respond adequately to the unmet need for treatment. Even in South Africa, which has more health care workers who are better paid compared to other southern African countries, unequal distribution and inadequate numbers of staff are causing delays to expanding treatment. 'Clinics are absolutely saturated, waiting lists are growing, and it feels like we are losing the battle,' said Dr. Eric Goemaere, head of MSFâ€™s program in Khayelitsha, Western Cape. 'For people making policies in offices far away from patients, our message is that you will be held responsible if you are not reactive or flexible enough to find solutions to the staff shortages.' To expand access to HIV care in rural settings, MSF teams have relied on 'task-shifting' from doctors to nurses, and from nurses to community workers. But these are limited measures that do not remove the need for additional skilled staff. 'It is incomprehensible that donors provide funds for life-long aids treatment and the building of new clinics, but refuse support for health care worker salaries on the grounds that this is unsustainable, said Sharonann Lynch, treatment literacy coordinator for MSF in Lesotho. 'People living with HIV/AIDS do not only need drugs and clinics; they need trained, motivated health care workers to diagnose, monitor, and treat them.' In the four countries profiled in this report, MSF is presently providing antiretroviral treatment (ART) for nearly 30,000 people. Worldwide, MSF provides ART to over 80,000 patients in more than 30 countries.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! I didn't think I would have time to blog, but with a little planning I was able to find some time to post some pics. The pictures today were taken from our interview with Secretary Rice yesterday at the President Ronald Reagan Library. Click here to check them out. You can see in the pics a little of the behind the scenes: How the interview was set up, etc., and where we conducted it in the library. We were disappointed that we missed seeing Mrs. Reagan while we were at the library. We were told that she goes to the library from time to time. She was due to arrive a short time after we left. Secretary Rice was giving a speech at the library upon invitation from Mrs. Reagan, so of course Mrs. Reagan would be there. After the interview we drove about an hour to FOX News' L.A. bureau. I was disappointed that I missed so many of my colleagues (Adam Housley I was told was en route to New York City to do some hosting this weekend on FOX; Anita Vogel was dispatched to do ""American Idol"" coverage), but there were also many of my colleagues who I did get to see. We used the L.A. bureau as a place to prepare for last night's show, but we then did the show at another studio (not our own). We could not do the show in our bureau because all resources were sent to help with ""American Idol"" coverage. As usual we are a bit short on sleep on this trip... while part of it is due to work and redeye flights, part of it is our own fault: We stayed out late Tuesday night having dinner with Pam Stevens who works at the State Department (and before that I worked with her at CNN. I have not seen Pam for more than 20 seconds in years... so I took advantage of the fact that we both were in the same city, both at the same hotel and both had to eat.) Tonight, tune in for my interview with Ozzy Osbourne: Yes, the interview I know you have all been waiting for (don't lie!) Ozzy is an extraordinary artist he has managed to stay on top in the music industry for decades.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! I didn't think I would have time to blog, but with a little planning I was able to find some time to post some pics. The pictures today were captured from our interview with Secretary Rice yesterday at the President Ronald Reagan Library. Click here to check them out. You can see in the pics a little of the behind the scenes: How the interview was set up, etc., and where we conducted it in the library. We were disappointed that we missed seeing Mrs. Reagan while we were at the library. We were told that she goes to the librarianship from time to time. She was due to arrive a short time after we left. Secretary Rice was giving another speech at the library upon invitation to Mrs. Reagan, so of course Mrs. Reagan would be there. After the interview we drove about an hour to FOX News' L.A. bureau. I were disappointed that I missed so many of my colleagues (Adam Housley I was told was en route to New York City to do some hosting this weekend on FOX; Anita Vogel was dispatched to do ""American Idol"" coverage), but there were also many of my colleagues whom I did get to see. We utilised the L.A. bureau as a place to prepare for last night's show, but we then did the show at another studio (not our own). ourselves could not do the show in our bureau because all resources were sent into help with ""American Idol"" coverage. As usual we are a bit short on sleep on this trip... while part of it is due to work and redeye flights, part of it is our distinctive fault: ourselves stayed out late Tuesday night having dinner with Pam Stevens who works at the State Department (and before that I worked with her at CNN. I have not seen Pam for more than 20 seconds in years... so I took advantage of the fact that we both were in the same city, both at the same hotel and both had to eat.) Tonight, tune in for my interview with Ozzy Osbourne: Yes, the interview I know you have all been waiting for (don't lie!) Ozzy is an extraordinary artist he has managed to stay on top in the music industry for decades. Whether you like his music or not, you have to take notice of the fact that he has done enormously fruitful per decades. So, check out the pics!

Your best bet is to search google and groups.google for ""perl threads"". Gather up all the example code you can, run them, and see how they work. You should also spend some time looking at threads in c, so you can see the difference in implementation. There are many good c thread tutorials on google. c threads make it much easier to share data and subroutines between threads. The best thing to do, is work out little example code snippets, and try to make the threads communicate. While doing that you will run into all the little details which you need to know.

Its objective is to drive the cost of drugs down to levels that patients can afford. The UK led initiative, called the Medicines Transparency Alliance, has just had its first stakeholder meeting and will be launched in the coming months. It will run pilot projects in up to nine countries. Its aim is to publish information on the amount, quality, and price of drugs in poor countries; to allow patients to see what they should pay and give them confidence in the quality and safety of the drugs; and to create a forum in each pilot country that will bring together patients, doctors, non-governmental organisations, and those involved in supplying drugs. Hilary Benn, secretary of state for international development, said at the stakeholder meeting: ""One third of the world's population has no access to the drugs they need to help them fight disease, and up to 30% of drugs available in the poorest countries are fake or substandard. Even when the right medicines are available they are unaffordable for the majority of people in developing countries, with mark-ups of up to 500% by some pharmacists."" The UK Department for International Development is also creating an international advisory body to inform it of new developments and to identify ways to obtain and deliver drugs at sensible prices to the developing world. At an international conference on access to drugs, hosted jointly by the department and the Lancet, the department's undersecretary of state, Gareth Thomas, challenged the drug industry, non-governmental organisations, and governments to find new ways to ensure that drugs reached people in developing countries at affordable prices. He invited participants at the conference to contribute to further debate at the department and to put themselves forward to join the advisory body. ""Finding new, innovative solutionsthrough new partnerships and networks, bringing down costs, accelerating research, [and] jumping over legal hurdlesis vital if we are to get serious about improving access to medicines for the poorest people of the world,"" said Mr Thomas. Presentations at the conference showed that success in reducing the cost of drugs in developing countries is not just about obtaining discounts from the industry and engineering flexibility in patent rightsthe subjects of media attention. Access to drugs is affected by every aspect of the supply process, delegates heard. Relevant factors included research into and development of treatments for neglected diseases; patent control over the manufacture and sale of drugs; competition with generic drugs; the supply chain by which the drugs are delivered; unethical local incentives to supply specific drugs; government support of health priorities; and the means by which hospitals and clinics are able to get payment for services to patients. Jonathan T Mwiindi, from the Ecumenical Pharmaceutical Network, Kenya, commented on the difficulty of dealing with the unethical and often invisible practices of intermediaries in the supply chain. For instance, retailers may receive incentives (such as a television) for stocking certain products; and prescribing patterns may be sold to agents, who then put pressure on individual doctors. He believes that there has been a shift from a culture of medical representatives offering information on the best use of drugs to one of sales representatives who are paid incentives to maximise volume generated from prescribers. Trevor Jones, former head of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, suggested a naming and shaming mechanism to counter bad practices. However, one of the conference participants pointed out that such a procedure might endanger the lives of the whistleblowers and the perpetrators in some countries. It was also pointed out that the local mark-up of drug prices is not always caused by corruption. In many hospitals most patients are unwilling to pay for ""non-tangibles,"" such as a consultation that results in no drug being prescribed. So the mark-up is sometimes the main way by which hospitals can cover their consultation and other costs, and it is the cheapest drugs that are most often heavily marked up. _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health","X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l4SM6MhB022760 http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/334/7599/870-a BMJ 2007;334:870 (28 April), doi:10.1136/bmj.39195.388356.DB [copied as fair use] Robert Short London A new organisation is being set up to increase transparency in the regulation, procurement, distribution, and sales of drugs in developing countries.

"RMCP Summer Goals, completed work should add value to its stock RMCP Summer Goals, completed work should add value to its stock src= Revolutions Medical Lays Out Its Plans For This Summer Revolutions Medical Lays Out Its Plans For This Summer MOUNT PLEASANT, S.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Revolutions Medical Corp (OTC:RMCP) has set certain goals for this summer that when completed should add value to its stock. These goals should propel the company forward as it enters the sales and marketing phase of its business plan. The company has been working towards 510K FDA submission for its RevVac safety syringe for the past several months. Its first goal is to complete and file this submission for all sizes of its safety syringe including 1cc, 3cc, 5cc, and 10cc with the FDA. Rev Med has hired and announced the two companies that are handling the submittal and the lab testing: Strategic Product Development and Son Medical. This syringe uses vacuum technology to suck the needle into the plunger after use. The syringe cannot be reused once the vacuum is activated. Rev Med believes its safety syringe has many advantages over its competition including price, ease of use, and safety. It should help reduce accidental needle stick injuries and also aid in reducing the spread of contagious diseases. You may view a video of the syringe in use on are website at www.revolutionsmedical.com. The company also believes that with the help of government regulation initiatives, individual s! tate laws, and the importance of world health concerns, the safety syringe market will continue to have substantial growth into the foreseeable future. With the recent completion of Clear Image Acquisition Corp, Revolutions Medical now controls exciting new software for MRIs and PACS. After securing this break through technology, Rev Meds second goal is to have test sites using this new software. Revolutions Medical will then be able to introduce this product to the imaging industry at the RSNA show in Chicago this fall. Revolutions Medical believes its software will enable doctors to see MRI images in color and 3D using automatic segmentation. These tools should help in quicker, more reliable diagnosis which will lower expenses and reduce time. The imaging market is in the billions and growing. Revolutions Medical believes that it will continue to grow as more and more uses are found for the MRI segment of this market. A video of this new softw! are can also be found on our company's website. About Revolutions Medical Corporation Revolutions Medical Corporation is committed to continually developing and distributing new products and tools to the medical industry, whether internally or through acquisitions. Its goals are to make health care safer and less expensive by reducing risks and cutting time and expenses. Its products include the RevVac safety syringe, safety blood drawing device and safety IV catheter. The world market for safety-engineered medical devices (SEMDs) is projected to exceed 2 billion this year and is forecasted to maintain a 20% annual growth rate in the near term. Revolutions Medical also provides software solutions and proprietary tools that are compatible with standard MRIs and standard PACS. The software includes sorting of images, color, 3D, and automatic segmentation of images. These tools will enhance the physician's diagnostic confidenc! e in an industry that is growing at 10% - 15% (more than 25 million procedures) per year with a worldwide market potential for these tools that exceed $3.5 billion.

[0]These networks are increasingly being used to trick PCs into attacking other machines, experts say. In fact, some reports indicate that peer-to-peer may actually exceed web traffic. Computer scientists have previously shown how P2P networks can be subverted so that several connected PCs gang up to attack a single machine, flooding it with enough traffic to make it crash. This can work even if the target is not part of the P2P network itself. Now, security experts are warning that P2P networks are increasingly being used to do just this. ""Until January of this year we had never seen a peer-to-peer network subverted and used for an attack,"" says Darren Rennick of internet security company Prolexic in an [1]advisory released recently.

First off, don't use prototypes until you know exactly what they do. They don't do what you think the do*. Don't worry about this though since they don't do what most people would expect them to (it is all getting fixed in Perl 6). Second off, it looks like your subroutine is written in Object Oriented Style, but you are calling it in Procedural Style. If this is not supposed to be an OO method than you should lose the ""my $self = shift;"" part. Also, going back to the first issue, prototypes are ignored for OO methods. Third off, ""my $id = @_;"" puts the array @_ in scalar context. That means it returns the number of elements in side of it, not the elements themselves.

First off, don't use prototypes till you know. abundantly what they do. They don't do what y think the do*. Don't fear around this though since they don't do what largest citizens ought expect them to (it is all getting fixed at Perl 6). Second off, it looks like your subroutine is written at Object guided Style, but you 're contacting him in Procedural Style. If this is not supposed to be an OO method after y should lose the ""my $self = shift;"" part. Also, goin back to the first issue, renderings 're forgotten per OO methods. Third off, ""my $id = @_;"" brings the range @_ onto scalar context. That means y profits the volume of elements at side of it, not the ingredients themselves. whether you exist indeed printing 3, then this is the probable culprit.

Allow me to summarize and repeat the problems with choice of venue clauses for the benifit of those who have not read the threads which I referenced earlier: Choice of venue clauses can short circuit the normal determination of jurisdiction in civil cases in some jurisdictions in some cases. In order to return to a sane jurisdiction, you generally must first get the choice of venue clause vacated, and only then do you start the normal change of venue process. Since there is no compulsion to agree to a license and the work is not being sold, it's less likely that such a clause will be vacated in comparison to the equivalent clause in shrinkwrap licenses.[1] Since this is giving up a right normally enjoyed in exchange for the ability to use or modify a work, it appears be a fee, and as such fails DFSG 1. Finally, by placing works under licenses with such clauses into non-free, we advise people that they should be examining the license more closely before deciding whether or not they should (or can) use the software. > And if you really want to have licenses determined by how people > ""feel"" rather than analysing the effects of the license in real > world situations as compared to what's actually written in the DFSG, > I expect you'll find we just end up with more GRs like the the GFDL > GR that doesn't match commonly held opinions on debian-legal at all. I'm personally using ""feel"" as shorthand for ""my understanding of the legal situtation regarding this clause and its relation to the DFSG"" not the way the clause effects me emotionally or what my DFSG dartboard said when I threw my official -legal flaming darts at it. I'm well aware that I'm personally more concerned about licensing matters than the average developer, but then again, that's also why I (perhaps navely) expect people who disagree with my analysis to actually engage the analysis with counter arguments, come to a complete understanding of the problem, and then make a determination. > And also realise that the only place your opinion is actually going > to have some effect is in packages you maintain, or if we hold a > poll or a vote, and posting to -legal isn't participating in either > of those.

"X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l54FUKhB029627 Last week, the Health & Consumer Commission of the Spanish Parliament unanimously supported the use of TRIPS flexibilities to provide access to medicines for developing countries and requested the Spanish Government to act in consequence. The request was amended to delete a reference to the Novartis/India case but it specifically mentions the Doha declaration, the recent WHA resolution 60.30, the need to stimulate innovation on diseases that disproportionally affect developing countries, and a call for WHO to technically and legally support countries that want to use the flexibilities. This request comes after similar ones by several regional governments and an excellent campaign lead by Oxfam and MSF Spain, that are now trying to obtain support from the Spanish government. MSF Spain coverage: http://www.msf.es/noticias/noticias_basicas/2007/ProposicinaprobadaCongreso.asp Intermon-Oxfam Spain coverage: http://www.intermonoxfam.org/page.asp?id=2005&ui=8407 New stories: http://www.canalsolidario.org/web/noticias/noticia/?id_noticia=8881 El Parlamento pide al Gobierno que apoye el acceso de pases empobrecidos a medicamentos genricos. El Congreso de los Diputados aprob el martes por unanimidad una proposicin no de Ley promovida por Intermn y Mdicos sin Fronteras sobre el acceso de los pases empobrecidos a medicamentos genricos. Redaccin (30/05/2007) El martes 29 de mayo, la Comisin de Sanidad y Consumo del Congreso de los Diputados aprob por unanimidad una proposicin no de Ley que insta al Gobierno espaol a apoyar el acceso a medicamentos por parte de los pases del Sur. El texto pide al Ejecutivo que d su apoyo a los pases empobrecidos para que, a pesar de las presiones de multinacionales farmacuticas, puedan aplicar las flexibilidades que se contemplan en los acuerdos de Propiedad Intelectual de la Organizacin Mundial de Comercio (OMC) ratificados en 2001 en Doha. A travs de estos acuerdos, la OMC reconoce a los Gobiernos del Sur a legislar en beneficio de la salud pblica aunque eso suponga contradecir las reglas de propiedad intelectual de la propia Organizacin Mundial del Comercio. Para Intermn Oxfam y Mdicos sin Fronteras, que el Congreso espaol hay aprobado la proposicin no de ley es una muy buena noticia y supone reconocer el derecho de los pases ms pobres a aplicar la legislacin aprobada en el seno de la OMC y defender el espritu de lo que se llam la ronda del desarrollo. La proposicin no de ley que ha aprobado el Congreso lleg a este organismo a iniciativa del grupo parlamentario vasco, Izquierda Unida-Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds y el grupo Mixto aunque, antes, los parlamentos del Pas Vasco, Navarra, Cantabria, Andaluca y Extremadura ya haban aprobado textos similares. El siguiente paso, dicen las ONG, es que el Gobierno espaol apoye decididamente la exportacin de medicamentos genricos a los pases empobrecidos. Segn Intermn Oxfam y MSF, la declaracin aprobada por el Congreso hace tambin referencia a la necesidad de estimular la innovacin para aquellos tratamientos requeridos exclusivamente en los pases pobres, lo que pone el dedo en la llaga sobre la necesidad de invertir ms fondos en la investigacin de frmacos para las llamadas enfermedades olvidadas, como la malaria o el mal de Chagas. Acceder a genricos para acceder a salud Como explican Mdicos sin Fronteras e Intermn, el acceso a medicamentos genricos ha hecho disminuir el precio de varios medicamentos de manera radical. Terapias contra el VIH/Sida que antes costaban 10.000 euros por paciente al ao ahora se obtienen por 300 euros y eso significa que millones de personas han podido tratarse en los ltimos aos y alargar su vida. En la actualidad, el principal productor de medicamentos genricos en el mundo es India, que exporta el 70% de ellos a otros pases en desarrollo. Lesotho, por ejemplo, importa el 95% de todos sus medicamentos para el sector pblico de distribuidores indios, lo mismo que el 70% de los tratamientos contra el VIH/Sida adquiridos por Unicef. Las presiones de multinacionales farmacuticas, sin embargo, estn obstaculizando la adquisicin y la produccin de estos medicamentos. Desde Intermn Oxfam y MSF recuerdan la demanda que la empresa Novartis ha interpuesto a la Ley de Patentes en India, pas que ms genricos produce y que mediante la normativa de patentes afirma que slo proteger mediante patentes los medicamentos que sean realmente innovaciones mdicas. Lejos de culpabilizar a las compaas farmacuticas, les pedimos que colaboren en facilitar el acceso a medicamentos para los pases en desarrollo, al contrario de lo que estn haciendo algunas multinacionales como Novartis en India, seala la presidenta de MSF en Espaa, Paula Farias, que pide a Novartis que retire de manera inmediata la demanda contra la ley india de patentes. Asimismo, al caso Novartis se suman otros como el de la farmacutica Abbott, que anunci su intencin de no comercializar sus nuevos frmacos en Tailandia despus de que este pas se acogiera a los acuerdos de Doha para poder obtener frmacos genricos ms baratos para sus pacientes de VIH/Sida y otras enfermedades. http://www.elglobal.net/articulo.asp?idcat=503&idart=273379 Apoyo pionero del Congreso al acceso a medicamentos Intermon y MSF piden al Gobierno espanol que apoye la resolucion Carlos B. Rodriguez Fecha de publicacin: Domingo, 3 de Junio de 2007 Ningn parlamento nacional se haba posicionado, hasta ahora, de una manera clara y concisa sobre las patentes de los medicamentos y el acceso a los frmacos en pases en vas de desarrollo. El espaol ha sido el primero, y lo ha hecho por unanimidad, como antes hicieron antes las Cortes de Navarra, Extremadura, Cantabria, Andaluca y Pas Vasco. Intermn y MSF piden ahora al Gobierno que apoye la propuesta. Los acuerdos unnimes no proliferan en el Parlamento espaol. El que se alcanz la semana pasada en el Congreso de los Diputados para que Espaa apoye que los pases en desarrollo apliquen las flexibilidades contenidas en los acuerdos de Doha para facilitar el acceso a los medicamentos pasar adems a la historia por pionero. Se trata de una iniciativa de Mdicos Sin Fronteras e Intermn-Oxfam que a nivel internacional cuenta con apoyos importantes, como un buen grupo de europarlamentarios o la ministra de Cooperacin alemana. No obstante, hasta ahora ningn parlamento nacional se haba posicionado de una manera tan clara al respecto. Este acuerdo, adems, vena precedido de otros tambin unnimes aprobados en diversas autonomas. La ms destacable, por haber puesto de acuerdo a PP y PSOE, es el Pas Vasco. Pero tambin estn Cantabria, Navarra, Andaluca y Extremadura. No son las nicas regiones cuyos Parlamentos han votado esta proposicin. Otras lo han hecho y el resultado ha sido negativo. El ejemplo ms claro, resaltan desde Mdicos Sin Fronteras, es el de Catalua. La historia de esta resolucin parte del ao 2006 y de la doble demanda interpuesta por Novartis contra el Gobierno de la India. En esos trminos, de hecho, se aprobaron las proposiciones autonmicas. Por sus caractersticas, en el Congreso de los Diputados este texto podra tramitarse tanto por la Comisin de Sanidad como por la de Cooperacin Internacional. Se intent por esta ltima, dado el inters que mostr su presidenta, Delia Blanco. Y se intent hacer, adems, por la va del procedimiento de urgencia, dado que en febrero terminaba el juicio de Novartis. Al mismo tiempo que desde la sede del PSOE en Ferraz se emiti un comunicado en el que peda pblicamente a Novartis que retirara su demanda contra el Gobierno indio, el conflicto entre las farmacuticas y los pases en vas de desarrollo empezaron a generalizarse: al 'asunto Glivec' se sumaban las contiendas entre Abbott y el Gobierno tailands por un tratamiento antisida y ms recientemente la disputa entre Merck y Brasil, tambin por la patente de otro frmaco contra el sida. Se impona una resolucin ms general, y sta es una de las razones por las que el Parlamento espaol ha ido ms all. Y ante los continuos retrasos que la mocin sufra en la Comisin de Cooperacin, el texto se traslad a Sanidad y Consumo. La redaccin final, aprobada tras una enmienda transaccional presentada por el diputado popular Jos Vadillo para no 'demonizar' a la industria farmacutica y aceptada por todos los grupos, no incluye alusiones al conflicto ocasionado por Glivec (/ver /EL GLOBAL/ n 238/), que s apareca en la propuesta original de los grupos Vasco, IU-Iniciativa per Catalua y Grupo Mixto.

The request was amended to delete a reference to the Novartis/India case but it specifically mentions the Doha declaration, the recent WHA resolution 60.30, the need to stimulate innovation on diseases that disproportionally affect developing countries, and a call for WHO to technically and legally support countries that want to use the flexibilities. This request comes after similar ones by several regional governments and an excellent campaign lead by Oxfam and MSF Spain, that are now trying to obtain support from the Spanish government. MSF Spain coverage: http://www.msf.es/noticias/noticias_basicas/2007/ProposicinaprobadaCongreso.asp Intermon-Oxfam Spain coverage: http://www.intermonoxfam.org/page.asp?id=2005&ui=8407 New stories: http://www.canalsolidario.org/web/noticias/noticia/?id_noticia=8881 El Parlamento pide al Gobierno que apoye el acceso de pases empobrecidos a medicamentos genricos. El Congreso de los Diputados aprob el martes por unanimidad una proposicin no de Ley promovida por Intermn y Mdicos sin Fronteras sobre el acceso de los pases empobrecidos a medicamentos genricos. Redaccin (30/05/2007) El martes 29 de mayo, la Comisin de Sanidad y Consumo del Congreso de los Diputados aprob por unanimidad una proposicin no de Ley que insta al Gobierno espaol a apoyar el acceso a medicamentos por parte de los pases del Sur. El texto pide al Ejecutivo que d su apoyo a los pases empobrecidos para que, a pesar de las presiones de multinacionales farmacuticas, puedan aplicar las flexibilidades que se contemplan en los acuerdos de Propiedad Intelectual de la Organizacin Mundial de Comercio (OMC) ratificados en 2001 en Doha. A travs de estos acuerdos, la OMC reconoce a los Gobiernos del Sur a legislar en beneficio de la salud pblica aunque eso suponga contradecir las reglas de propiedad intelectual de la propia Organizacin Mundial del Comercio. Para Intermn Oxfam y Mdicos sin Fronteras, que el Congreso espaol hay aprobado la proposicin no de ley es una muy buena noticia y supone reconocer el derecho de los pases ms pobres a aplicar la legislacin aprobada en el seno de la OMC y defender el espritu de lo que se llam la ronda del desarrollo. La proposicin no de ley que ha aprobado el Congreso lleg a este organismo a iniciativa del grupo parlamentario vasco, Izquierda Unida-Iniciativa per Catalunya Verds y el grupo Mixto aunque, antes, los parlamentos del Pas Vasco, Navarra, Cantabria, Andaluca y Extremadura ya haban aprobado textos similares. El siguiente paso, dicen las ONG, es que el Gobierno espaol apoye decididamente la exportacin de medicamentos genricos a los pases empobrecidos. Segn Intermn Oxfam y MSF, la declaracin aprobada por el Congreso hace tambin referencia a la necesidad de estimular la innovacin para aquellos tratamientos requeridos exclusivamente en los pases pobres, lo que pone el dedo en la llaga sobre la necesidad de invertir ms fondos en la investigacin de frmacos para las llamadas enfermedades olvidadas, como la malaria o el mal de Chagas. Acceder a genricos para acceder a salud Como explican Mdicos sin Fronteras e Intermn, el acceso a medicamentos genricos ha hecho disminuir el precio de varios medicamentos de manera radical. Terapias contra el VIH/Sida que antes costaban 10.000 euros por paciente al ao ahora se obtienen por 300 euros y eso significa que millones de personas han podido tratarse en los ltimos aos y alargar su vida. En la actualidad, el principal productor de medicamentos genricos en el mundo es India, que exporta el 70% de ellos a otros pases en desarrollo. Lesotho, por ejemplo, importa el 95% de todos sus medicamentos para el sector pblico de distribuidores indios, lo mismo que el 70% de los tratamientos contra el VIH/Sida adquiridos por Unicef. Las presiones de multinacionales farmacuticas, sin embargo, estn obstaculizando la adquisicin y la produccin de estos medicamentos. Desde Intermn Oxfam y MSF recuerdan la demanda que la empresa Novartis ha interpuesto a la Ley de Patentes en India, pas que ms genricos produce y que mediante la normativa de patentes afirma que slo proteger mediante patentes los medicamentos que sean realmente innovaciones mdicas. Lejos de culpabilizar a las compaas farmacuticas, les pedimos que colaboren en facilitar el acceso a medicamentos para los pases en desarrollo, al contrario de lo que estn haciendo algunas multinacionales como Novartis en India, seala la presidenta de MSF en Espaa, Paula Farias, que pide a Novartis que retire de manera inmediata la demanda contra la ley india de patentes. Asimismo, al caso Novartis se suman otros como el de la farmacutica Abbott, que anunci su intencin de no comercializar sus nuevos frmacos en Tailandia despus de que este pas se acogiera a los acuerdos de Doha para poder obtener frmacos genricos ms baratos para sus pacientes de VIH/Sida y otras enfermedades. http://www.elglobal.net/articulo.asp?idcat=503&idart=273379 Apoyo pionero del Congreso al acceso a medicamentos Intermon y MSF piden al Gobierno espanol que apoye la resolucion Carlos B. Rodriguez Fecha de publicacin: Domingo, 3 de Junio de 2007 Ningn parlamento nacional se haba posicionado, hasta ahora, de una manera clara y concisa sobre las patentes de los medicamentos y el acceso a los frmacos en pases en vas de desarrollo. El espaol ha sido el primero, y lo ha hecho por unanimidad, como antes hicieron antes las Cortes de Navarra, Extremadura, Cantabria, Andaluca y Pas Vasco. Intermn y MSF piden ahora al Gobierno que apoye la propuesta. Los acuerdos unnimes no proliferan en el Parlamento espaol. El que se alcanz la semana pasada en el Congreso de los Diputados para que Espaa apoye que los pases en desarrollo apliquen las flexibilidades contenidas en los acuerdos de Doha para facilitar el acceso a los medicamentos pasar adems a la historia por pionero. Se trata de una iniciativa de Mdicos Sin Fronteras e Intermn-Oxfam que a nivel internacional cuenta con apoyos importantes, como un buen grupo de europarlamentarios o la ministra de Cooperacin alemana. No obstante, hasta ahora ningn parlamento nacional se haba posicionado de una manera tan clara al respecto. Este acuerdo, adems, vena precedido de otros tambin unnimes aprobados en diversas autonomas. La ms destacable, por haber puesto de acuerdo a PP y PSOE, es el Pas Vasco. Pero tambin estn Cantabria, Navarra, Andaluca y Extremadura. No son las nicas regiones cuyos Parlamentos han votado esta proposicin. Otras lo han hecho y el resultado ha sido negativo. El ejemplo ms claro, resaltan desde Mdicos Sin Fronteras, es el de Catalua. La historia de esta resolucin parte del ao 2006 y de la doble demanda interpuesta por Novartis contra el Gobierno de la India. En esos trminos, de hecho, se aprobaron las proposiciones autonmicas. Por sus caractersticas, en el Congreso de los Diputados este texto podra tramitarse tanto por la Comisin de Sanidad como por la de Cooperacin Internacional. Se intent por esta ltima, dado el inters que mostr su presidenta, Delia Blanco. Y se intent hacer, adems, por la va del procedimiento de urgencia, dado que en febrero terminaba el juicio de Novartis. Al mismo tiempo que desde la sede del PSOE en Ferraz se emiti un comunicado en el que peda pblicamente a Novartis que retirara su demanda contra el Gobierno indio, el conflicto entre las farmacuticas y los pases en vas de desarrollo empezaron a generalizarse: al 'asunto Glivec' se sumaban las contiendas entre Abbott y el Gobierno tailands por un tratamiento antisida y ms recientemente la disputa entre Merck y Brasil, tambin por la patente de otro frmaco contra el sida. Se impona una resolucin ms general, y sta es una de las razones por las que el Parlamento espaol ha ido ms all. Y ante los continuos retrasos que la mocin sufra en la Comisin de Cooperacin, el texto se traslad a Sanidad y Consumo. La redaccin final, aprobada tras una enmienda transaccional presentada por el diputado popular Jos Vadillo para no 'demonizar' a la industria farmacutica y aceptada por todos los grupos, no incluye alusiones al conflicto ocasionado por Glivec (/ver /EL GLOBAL/ n 238/), que s apareca en la propuesta original de los grupos Vasco, IU-Iniciativa per Catalua y Grupo Mixto. En el mismo sentido que el PP se manifest el Grupo de CiU, cuyo portavoz en la Comisin de Sanidad del Congreso, Jordi Xucl, rechaz la redaccin inicial para ""no atenerse a una querella presentada entre una empresa concreta y un Gobierno"". Adems de instar al Estado espaol a apoyar la flexibilidad de los estados en la interpretacin sobre las patentes de frmacos establecida por la Organizacin Mundial del Comercio, as como la exportacin de genricos a pases pobres y la innovacin farmacutica para las enfermedades de esos pases, el texto subraya, a instancias de una enmienda del PSOE, el apoyo a la resolucin sobre salud pblica y propiedad intelectual adoptada en la Asamblea de la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud el pasado 23 de mayo y aceptada por la mayora de los pases, incluidos Brasil e India.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! We interviewed Larry Birkhead Thursday afternoon at the Los Angeles home that now belongs to his daughter, Dannilynn. The interview was taped and will air on Monday night. We showed a few seconds of our interview last night on our show, but plan to show it Monday. I enjoyed doing the interview. I have interviewed Larry before but not since the DNA tests established his paternity. He is now trying to map out his and his daughter's future. It was fun to also meet Dannilynn. She is a very pretty little girl and very good natured. She was born in September and is now at the stage where she stands (sort of). On Monday you will get a close up of father and daughter and not a bad time to get it with Father's Fay approaching. I suspect that single parents will particularly like this interview. En route back to our L.A. bureau after the interview to do our Thursday show, we decided to detour past Paris Hilton 's house. When we awoke yesterday we heard that she had been released. We were curious as to how curious the media was about her return to her home. Yes, the media was very curious. There were cameras, reporters, satellite trucks and the police (who were annoyed at people blocking the street.) One of my colleagues jumped out of our car and snapped some pictures which are posted on today's blog. Click here to check out the photo essay You can see the outside of Paris' Hollywood home and Paris' mother and father arriving to visit her. There are some great pics of Kathy Hilton. The pics give you a bit of an idea of the media crowd the parents had to slide through to get to their daughter's door. At the time the pics were taken, all seemed to be going well for Paris... but that did not last long. By the end of the day, many had grown outraged at her change in confinement (from 23 days in jail to 40 days in her home.) By early evening last night, the city attorney filed a motion asking the judge to send her back to the jail. I have no clue what the judge will do, but do know that at 9 a.m. today (Friday), Paris is ordered back to court to find out. We had tickets to take the redeye home last night but alas, we did not take it. About 9 p.m. ET (right before we did our show and then planned to go to LAX), FOX asked us to stay to cover the 9 a.m. Paris hearing this morning. While I would love to be home (road trips can get to you after awhile), I am also content to stay and cover the hearing. I suppose it also makes sense to keep me here to cover it since I am a lawyer. If you saw last night's segment on Catherine Herridge and her son Peter you saw that Catherine and I were dressed alike in the segment... no, that was not a plan, just a coincidence (but it did look funny on camera!) My husband complained after he saw the segment that we had not named the hospital (the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) and that we did not provide a Web site where people can make donations. So here it is: www.upmc.com/Services/TransplantationServices/default.htm. Now people can make donations... and so can my husband, who complained! Now for some e-mails: E-mail No. 1 Don't understand the logic of the whole Paris Hilton saga, however, the behavior of not only Paris, but her mother has convinced me the Hilton Corporation is not worth supporting. If they feel their family is not only above the law but above the public then let them stay in their own hotels, I will not do it again. Time to send the Hiltons a message. Thank you, Cathy Samuel E-mail No. 2 Greta, it makes my blood boil to hear that Paris Hilton is out of jail. That is the best place for her if she can't stay from behind the wheel when she has been drinking. If this had been the first time she was in trouble because of driving while intoxicated, I might be able to understand today's actions. If she had ran into a car that your mom, dad, spouse, brothers, sisters, etc., were in and killed them I guess she would have to spend a little time in jail. I believe she should have been housed with the rest of the population there at the jail 90 days (or more). Only time will tell but I doubt that she has learned anything, except that her money will buy her out of trouble. You have been saying the punishment was too harsh for Paris give me a break. Frances E-mail No. 3 Okay, Greta, I'm staying up to watch your show at 10. I want to know the latest on Paris may be going back to jail. I just heard this on ""Hannity & Colmes."" I hope the panel is on tonight. I love them. Love your show. Beverly Benson Cuyahoga Falls, OH E-mail No. 4 Thanks to Paris Hilton I now know what to do if I ever get in trouble. I have to hire a PR person to tell the world how fragile I am. Then, after incarceration I have to throw a major hissy fit. Then I get to go home. Thanks Paris. Julianne Hall Spielas City, CA E-mail No. 5 Hi Greta, Just watched your first video blog. It's good to see and hear you talking off the cuff. I got a kick out of your colleague. Her chartreuse suitcase is actually a good idea so easy to spot on a luggage carousel! Was the interview with Dr. Baden added later? I look forward to your future video blogs, which you also could call video Web casts or vidcasts for short. Take care! George E-mail No. 6 Dear Greta I'm watching the heated debate about Paris Hilton right now. First: I work at UCDavisMC. Every night I work we have inmates from the asundry of jails and prisons around here for EVERYTHING. Any 'boo boo' or pain. Rx's CAN and do get administered in jail. Second: If Paris has mental problems and is on Rx, she could never be drinking the way she does. The medications and alcohol are never to be mixed. Third: It is appearing she has an MO of getting mentally ill to divert legal issues. She is rich, blond and pretty... SHE tells the world how to revolve, not the other way around. Anyone with an ounce of sense could see this coming from the get go. I expected it, and figure it was all preplanned. Christie Radford CA E-mail No. 7 RIDE ON TED! Fire that sheriff would have never happened to anyone else. Maybe the sheriff will have free rooms at Hiltons around the world from now on. E-mail No. 8 Greta: Welcome to Sheriff Baca's Notorious Let The Celebrities Out Of Jail Free Card. The Sheriff has been letting Celebrities out of Jail Early cause he is Star Struck. Paris Hilton should be sent back to Jail with the Original time that was given her. Watch the Local media's Interviews with the Women Inmates that were released and hear there stories of how they spent more time in Jail for Less than what Paris Hilton did. If Paris Hilton has Mental Problems then her License should be Taken Away before she Kills somebody. Ron Agalsoff El Monte, CA E-mail No. 9 Hi Greta, Has this sheriff ever taken other prisoners with medical problems and put them under house arrest or is Paris the first? Can a sheriff change the sentence from jail to house arrest without going to the judge who imposed sentence? If she has medical or mental problem why not put her in hospital for treatment and complete her sentence later? Thanks, Anna E-mail No. 10 They can make all the excuses they want, but tough! Send her back to finish her time. This is a real bad message to send others. Spie Bradenton, FL E-mail No. 11 Greta, Medication dosages are based on the person's weight. There is no way that Paris should require a dosage that needs outside monitoring. I personally don't believe that she could tolerate a very high dose. Wouldn't make good medical sense. Love your show. I am here every night!! Thank you Julie Ann Clark, RN E-mail No. 12 Greta, Just seen your interview with Catherine. Peter is so adorable... and healthy looking now. It's a good change to hear happy news for a change. Kathi Grand Rapids, MI E-mail No. 13 Dear Catherine and Greta, Very, Very Happy For Peter's recovery... And Thank You Greta for the Follow-up. Please Forgive Me, But I would Also Like to Know if Louis the Cat of Connecticut made it Like Paris, He was Confined to Home Prison. ANSWER: I confess, like you, I love Lewis the cat. I will try and get an update. E-mail No. 14 Dear Greta: Okay, I know you'll say that everyone grieves differently, and fortunately, I have not lost a loved one to murder, so.... That being said, I think that was a most unusual interview you had with the family of Kelsey Smith and her boyfriend. They seemed way too jokey and cheerful under the circumstances. I've never seen anything like it, but you probably have in your years of professional experience. I'm just a wee bit dumbfounded. Too weird for me, and I live in the L.A. area. Proves I haven't seen it all. Julia Smith Grossman Santa Monica, CA P.S. Catherine Herridge must be one of the most grateful people on the planet. E-mail No. 15 Dear Greta, While your show has always been full of sensationalism, and not consistent with the political, newsworthy nature of FOX News, I have to say that, tonight, I have had my fill. I don't know which is more stomach turning: watching you stalk Kelsey's family the day after the discovery of her body; or the fact the family agreed to be on television, smiling, jovial and using a derogatory word to describe part of her personality (the ""B"" word)... all at a time that, for most, would be their darkest moments. I'd like to chalk their behavior up to a family for which the gravity of the truth has not yet sunk in... but for you to choose to exploit them while they're in this state of mind is beyond my comprehension.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! We interviewed Larry Birkhead Thursday afternoon at the Los Angeles home that now belongs to his daughter, Dannilynn. The interview was taped and will air on Monday night. We showed a few seconds of our interview last night on our show, but plan to show it Monday. I enjoyed doing the interview. I have interviewed Larry before but not since the DNA ordeals established his paternity. He is now trying to map out his and his daughter's future. It was fun to also meet Dannilynn. She is a very pretty little girl and very good natured. She were born throughout September and is now at the stage where she stands (sort of). On Monday you will get a close up of father and daughter and not a bad time to get it with Father's Fay approaching. I suspect that single parents will particularly like this interview. En route back to our L.A. bureau after the interview to do our Thursday show, we decided to detour past Paris Hilton 's house. When we awoke yesterday we heard that she had been released. We were curious as to how curious the media was about her return to her home. Yes, the media was very curious. There were cameras, reporters, satellite trucks and the police (who were annoyed at people blocking the street.) One of my colleagues jumped out of our car and snapped some pictures which are posted on today's blog. Click here to check out the photo essay You can see the outside of Paris' Hollywood home and Paris' mother and father arriving to visit her. There are some great pics of Kathy Hilton. The pics give you a bit of an idea of the media crowd the parents had to slide through to get to their daughter's door. At the time the pics were taken, all seemed to be going well for Paris... but that did not last long. By the end of the day, many had grown outraged at her change in confinement (from 23 days in jail to 40 days in her home.) By early evening last night, the city attorney filed a motion asking the judge to send her back to the jail. I have no clue what the judge will do, but do know that at 9 a.m. today (Friday), Paris is ordered back to court to find out. We had tickets to take the redeye home last night but alas, we did not take it. About 9 p.m. ET (right before we did our show and then planned to go to LAX), FOX asked us to stay to cover the 9 a.m. Paris hearing this morning. While I would love to be home (road trips can get to you after awhile), I am also content to stay and cover the hearing. I suppose it also makes sense to keep me here to cover it since I am a lawyer. If you saw last night's segment on Catherine Herridge and her son Peter you saw that Catherine and I were dressed alike in the segment... no, that was not a plan, just a coincidence (but it did look funny on camera!) My husband complained after he saw the segment that we had not named the hospital (the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center) and that we did not provide a Web site where people can make donations. So here it is: www.upmc.com/Services/TransplantationServices/default.htm. Now people can make donations... and so can my husband, who complained! Now for some e-mails: E-mail No. 1 Don't understand the logic of the whole Paris Hilton saga, however, the behavior of not only Paris, but her mother has convinced me the Hilton Corporation is not worth supporting. If they feel their family is not only above the law but above the public then let them stay in their own hotels, I will not do it again. Time to send the Hiltons a message. Thank you, Cathy Samuel E-mail No. 2 Greta, it makes my blood boil to hear that Paris Hilton is out of jail. That is the best place for her if she can't stay from behind the wheel when she has been drinking. If this had been the first time she was in trouble because of driving while intoxicated, I might be able to understand today's actions. If she had ran into a car that your mom, dad, spouse, brothers, sisters, etc., were in and killed them I guess she would have to spend a little time in jail. I believe she should have been housed with the rest of the population there at the jail 90 days (or more). Only time will tell but I doubt that she has learned anything, except that her money will buy her out of trouble. You have been saying the punishment was too harsh for Paris give me a break. Frances E-mail No. 3 Okay, Greta, I'm staying up to watch your show at 10. I want to know the latest on Paris may be going back to jail. I just heard this on ""Hannity & Colmes."" I hope the panel is on tonight. I love them. Love your show. Beverly Benson Cuyahoga Falls, OH E-mail No. 4 Thanks to Paris Hilton I now know what to do if I ever get in trouble. I have to hire a PR person to tell the world how fragile I am. Then, after incarceration I have to throw a big hissy fit. Then I get to go home. Thanks Paris. Julianne Hall Spielas City, CA E-mail No. 5 Hi Greta, Just watched your first video blog. It's good to see and hear you talking off the cuff. I got a kick out of your colleague. Her chartreuse suitcase is actually a good idea so easy to spot on a luggage carousel! Was the interview with Dr. Baden added later? I look forward to your future video blogs, which you also could call video Web casts or vidcasts for short. Take care! George E-mail No. 6 Dear Greta I'm watching the heated debate about Paris Hilton right now. First: I work at UCDavisMC. Every night I work we have inmates from the asundry of jails and prisons around here for EVERYTHING. Any 'boo boo' or pain. Rx's CAN and do get administered in jail. Second: If Paris has mental problems and is on Rx, she could never be drinking the way she does. The medications and alcohol are never to be mixed. Third: It is appearing she has an MO of getting mentally ill to divert legal issues. She is rich, blond and pretty... SHE tells the world how to revolve, not the other way around. Anyone with an ounce of sense could see this coming from the get go. I expected it, and figure it was all preplanned. Christie Radford CA E-mail No. 7 RIDE ON TED! Fire that sheriff would have never happened to anyone else. Maybe the sheriff will have free rooms at Hiltons around the world from now on. E-mail No. 8 Greta: Welcome to Sheriff Baca's Notorious Let The Celebrities Out Of Jail Free Card. The Sheriff has been letting Celebrities out of Jail Early cause he is Star Struck. Paris Hilton should be sent back to Jail with the Original time that was given her. Watch the Local media's Interviews with the Women Inmates that were released and hear there stories of how they spent more time in Jail for Less than what Paris Hilton did. If Paris Hilton has Mental Problems then her License should be Taken Away before she Kills somebody. Ron Agalsoff El Monte, CA E-mail No. 9 Hi Greta, Has this sheriff ever taken other prisoners with medical problems and put them under house arrest or is Paris the first? Can a sheriff change the sentence from jail to house arrest without going to the judge who imposed sentence? If she has medical or mental problem why not put her in hospital for treatment and complete her sentence later? Thanks, Anna E-mail No. 10 They can make all the excuses they want, but tough! Send her back to finish her time. This is a real bad message to send others. Spie Bradenton, FL E-mail No. 11 Greta, Medication dosages are based on the person's weight. There is no way that Paris should require a dosage that needs outside monitoring. I personally don't believe that she could tolerate a very high dose. Wouldn't make good medical sense. Love your show. I am here every night!! Thank you Julie Ann Clark, RN E-mail No. 12 Greta, Just seen your interview with Catherine. Peter is so adorable... and healthy looking now. It's a good change to hear happy news for a change. Kathi Grand Rapids, MI E-mail No. 13 Dear Catherine and Greta, Very, Very Happy For Peter's recovery... And Thank You Greta for the Follow-up. Please Forgive Me, But I would Also Like to Know if Louis the Cat of Connecticut made it Like Paris, He was Confined to Home Prison. ANSWER: I confess, like you, I love Lewis the cat. I will try and get an update. E-mail No. 14 Dear Greta: Okay, I know you'll say that everyone grieves differently, and fortunately, I have not lost a loved one to murder, so.... That being said, I think that was a most unusual interview you had with the family of Kelsey Smith and her boyfriend. They seemed way too jokey and cheerful under the circumstances. I've never seen anything like it, but you probably have in your years of professional experience. I'm just a wee bit dumbfounded. Too weird for me, and I live in the L.A. area. Proves I haven't seen it all. Julia Smith Grossman Santa Monica, CA P.S. Catherine Herridge must be one of the most grateful people on the planet. E-mail No. 15 Dear Greta, While your show has always been full of sensationalism, and not consistent with the political, newsworthy nature of FOX News, I have to say that, tonight, I have had my fill. I don't know which is more stomach turning: watching you stalk Kelsey's family the day after the discovery of her body; or the fact the family agreed to be on television, smiling, jovial and using a derogatory word to describe part of her personality (the ""B"" word)... all at a time that, for most, would be their darkest moments. I'd like to chalk their behavior up to a family for which the gravity of the truth has not yet sunk in... but for you to choose to exploit them while they're in this state of mind is beyond my comprehension. I'm disgusted at your vulture-like behavior. I'll be tuning in elsewhere during your show from now on.

I have a small sample program: > bitmap(""a.bmp"") > m=(1) > plot(m) > dev.off() With R 2.2.1, it works well, but with R 2.4.1 it fails when gswin32c is launched with following error: Error: /undefined in WinAnsiEncoding The difference between the two temporary files produced by the two versions of R before to launch gswin32c, is that in file produced by R 2.4.1, a part of the postscript command are surrounded by following lines: /WinAnsiEncoding [ ...some poscript commands... ] It seems gswin32c does not understand this ""/WinAnsiEncoding ["" line. As I am not even a newbye in postscript maybe this line is correct, and there is a bug in gswin32c, but I would like to ask if some R people already encountered this problem and how did they manage to solve it.

The suggestion of reducing patent life for me-too's/new formulations (pg 8) is noteworthy. However, that is clouded by the idea of increasing patent terms to 25 years (or even 50 years for groundbreaking vaccines provided they are sold at universally affordable prices) to incentivise more innovation for creating novel (which is not defined) products to serve unmet medical needs. Tahir Initiative for Medicines, Access & Knowledge (I-MAK) Drugs industry economics 'not sustainable' - report *Marianne Barriaux Wednesday June 13, 2007 The Guardian * The pharmaceutical industry business model is ""economically unsustainable"", according to a report by accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers. The study suggested drug companies' reliance on heavy marketing of a few drugs in the hope of huge sales meant they were ""operationally incapable"" of acting quickly enough to produce innovative treatments demanded by global markets. According to Steve Arlington, the main author, drug companies spend twice as much on research and development than 10 years ago, yet produce half as many drugs: 40 to 45% of medicines in phase 3 clinical trials, the last stage, now failed. Shares in pharmaceutical companies have not performed well, sales and marketing costs have increased, as have legal and regulatory constraints and the reputation of the industry has been tarnished by high-profile cases such as Vioxx, Merck's painkiller that has provoked thousands of lawsuits. Healthcare providers and payers are keen to reduce the amount they pay for treatment. People are living longer but not necessarily healthier lives, leading to predictions of a global pharmaceuticals market that will more than double in value to 660bn by 2020. Dr Arlington said the pharmaceutical industry would have to change to capitalise on these opportunities, partly by shifting its investment focus towards research and less on sales and marketing. ""It must focus mainly on the development of medicines that prevent or cure. But in all cases, the drugs will have to demonstrate tangible benefits and tackle unmet medical needs."" The pharmaceutical industry needed to come together with other relevant players - governments, patients and investors - to discuss the best way forward. One of his suggestions was that patent protection for drugs, set at about 20 years, could be extended to a much longer period to incentivise the companies to produce more innovative drugs and sell them at a lower cost. The report suggested expanding the pool in which companies fish for basic research - to Asia, for example, where research is less expensive - or increasing cooperation with academia. It also mentioned the need to transform the way companies performed R&D, by focusing on building a much better understanding of the disease itself to accelerate research. There is some evidence that pharmaceutical companies are starting to change their research models. GlaxoSmithKline, for example, today opens a 50m clinical imaging centre at Hammersmith Hospital in conjunction with Imperial College and the Medical Research Council. GSK said the facility would allow it to partner academia to use the latest advancements in imaging to better understand diseases and how to treat them, speeding up the development of new drugs. The report concluded the industry would have to move fast to make these changes, or face another round of mergers and acquisitions with leading companies falling into private equity hands. *Patent medicines* The top pharmaceutical companies are expected to lose 14%-41% of their existing revenues by 2012 as *patents* expire. *Pfizer* will suffer the expiry of patents for *Viagra *and *Lipitor*, the world's best-selling medicine, leading to the loss of about 41% of its revenues. *AstraZeneca* is expected to shed about 38% of its sales and *GSK* sees the patents of its two best-selling drugs - *Advair *and *Avandia *- expire by 2012, with a predicted loss of 23% of revenues. -- X-Attachment-Id: f_f2vo0ja1 [ PWC Pharma Vision 2020 Which path will you take.pdf of type application/pdf deleted ] _______________________________________________ Ip-health mailing list Ip-health@lists.essential.org http://lists.essential.org/mailman/listinfo/ip-health","X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l5DHXIL9010392 ; ; [ Picked text/plain from multipart/alternative ) A copy of the report is attached.

The problem here isn't the content of this specific bill (which isn't really bad), but the process by which it came forward. The same lobbying tactics may be successful in getting extremely harmful bills brought forward and fast-tracked without consultation or debate. The Senate has its hands full with other bills (including the budget bill), and it is highly unlikely they will debate it at all. The Government wants to prorogue rather than recess for the summer as they want to Kill Bill C-30 (the by-committee revised Clean air and Climate Change act). If they prorogue then this causes all unpassed bills die on the order paper, meaning all government and private members bills would have to be re-introduces and the Conservatives don't want there to be a climate change act. Some Liberal members of the senate have said they will delay the budget bill to force the Conservatives to recess, allowing them to pass the budget without this immediately killing C-30. This is all typical procedural trickery that the Conservatives are into. I've seen them pull some pretty nasty fast ones, including last Friday when they tried to pass the budget through a loophole that involved a motion changing the order of business after most parliamentarians were already heading back to constituencies. Fortunately this one was caught (people running back into the house who were otherwise heading for a plane). Pretty dishonest stuff, but not stuff the general public would understand -- and thus stuff they can get away with without voters getting upset. I wonder how much of this was in their controversial Handbook they created to describe how to manipulate parliament and committees. BTW: I'm not wanting to pick on the Conservatives. At least old-school Liberal members are generally honest about their hatred for the Internet and new media/new economy. The Conservatives seem to rather avoid answering controversial questions and prefer to use procedural trickery.

As both Mark and brian have pointed out, this really comes down to philosophical differences that no amount of discussion is going to resolve. In any case, I'm sure that Larry now has plenty of ""grist"" from which to mill a final specification of how the Perl 6 documentation mechanism will work. I will, however, take a moment to answer the accusation that I appear to have redesigned Pod the way I did in order to make implementation easier...and at the expense of making life harder for programmers and educators. It's hard to believe anyone could think I would ever do that. It's almost as if the they don't know me at all. From the very first day I became part of the Perl community (August 18, 1998, when I presented Getopt::Declare and Lingua::EN::Inflect at the Second Perl Conference), my entire philosophy and purpose has been to make things *easier* for users of Perl, no matter what that did to the complexity of the implementation. Every serious module I've ever written over the subsequent decade has had that same characteristic and intended function: Attribute::Handlers, Class::Contract, Class::Multimethods, Class::Std, Config::Std, Contextual::Return, Filter::Simple, Getopt::Euclid, IO::Prompt, Module::Starter, NEXT, Parse::RecDescent, Regexp::Common, Smart::Comments, Switch, Text::Autoformat...etc., etc. Indeed the term ""a Damian module"" is now widely used to mean ""software that makes your life easier...until you actually try to read the source or understand the implementation"". :-) I've always been quite proud of that...since that description is pretty much the definition of the perl interpreter itself. I always felt that meant I was doing my job right. I've also lectured and taught academic and professional classes on interface design for several decades now, and always with that same basic message: make life easier for the user, no matter how much that complicates the implementor's job. Certainly, anyone who has sat in on a Perl 6 design meeting will tell you that I've consistently argued that way; frequently to the point of aggravating those courageous souls who are charged with the task of implementing Perl 6. So it actually *hurts* me that people might think I would ever compromise on usability, just to facilitate implementability. Please read what I wrote again. I *did* claim that ""easier to implement"" was a nice side-benefit of my design...but only because I was directly responding to brian's question about Pod 6's adaptability to other programming languages. I *never* said ease-of-implementation was a major consideration, of a motivation for, or even a significant argument in favour of, the original design. My entire argument for separated Pod is based on promoting the prominence and readability of Pod documentation by distinguishing it lexically, rather than syntactically. Enough. I will now get back to designing the new A formatting code ('A' for *A*lias to *A*mbient *A*rtifact), which I'll preview early next week. Though I'm sure people won't like that new feature either, since it's going to be designed using the same ""separated model"" philosophy. ;-) Damian","Sender: Damian Conway X-Old-Spam-Check-By: la.mx.develooper.com X-Old-Spam-Status: No, hits=1.0 required=8.0 tests=BAYES_50,DKIM_SIGNED,DKIM_VERIFIED,DK_POLICY_SIGNSOME,DK_SIGNED,FUZZY_AMBIEN,SPF_PASS I'm not going to argue about the design of Pod 6 any more.

I *never* said ease-of-implementation was a huge consideration, of a motivation for, or even another significant argument onto favour of, the original design. My entire argument for separated Pod is based on promoting the visibility nor readability of Pod documentation via distinguishing y lexically, rather than syntactically. Enough. I will now get back to designing the new A formatting code ('A' for *A*lias to *A*mbient *A*rtifact), which I'll preview early next week. Though I'm sure people won't like that new feature either, since it's going to be designed utilising the same ""separated model"" philosophy. ;-) Damian",Ham,Yes,2875,2928,68.45238095238095,69.71428571428571,5.604288499025341,5.707602339181286,861,869,20.5,20.69047619047619,1.6783625730994152,1.6939571150097466,64.71734892787524,63.35282651072125,17.15399610136452,18.323586744639375,8.966861598440545,9.551656920077972,8.771929824561402,8.382066276803119,0.10932362844127552,0.11713054457619675,0.4260536032594856,0.48558841520798035,35.71,32.46,52.9500756429652,50.832072617246595,140.8635242619796,178.97561150307348,36.00605143721634,34.34190620272315,11.195158850226928,11.043872919818456,7.866868381240545,7.715582450832073,21.482602118003026,21.331316187594553,6.656580937972769,6.505295007564296,6.051437216338881,6.354009077155824,8.925869894099849,9.07715582450832,9.379727685325264,9.984871406959153,4.236006051437216,4.084720121028744,4.236006051437216,4.236006051437216,5.597579425113464,5.597579425113464,0.0,0.0

"Man gets jail term for theft of artwork WAILUKU - A one-year jail term was ordered for a Lahaina man as he was sentenced Thursday for the theft of artwork from galleries on Front Street last year. William Vannatta III, 45, said he was ""deeply grateful"" for the plea agreement recommending that he be placed on probation for the crimes. ""I have a lot of regrets,"" he said. ""I'm sorry for the things I did."" Vannatta had pleaded no contest to five counts of second-degree theft of paintings, sculptures and an autographed guitar from the galleries from last June to October. Deputy Public Defender Jon Apo said Vannatta had ""cooperated fully"" with police Lt. Don Simpson to recover much of the artwork. According to court records, the stolen artwork included paintings depicting John Lennon and Elvis Presley and glass sculptures. Following terms of the plea agreement, 2nd Circuit Judge Joseph Cardoza imposed the one-year jail term as part of five years' probation for Vannatta. He was ordered to pay $940 in restitution for sculptures stolen from one gallery. http://www.mauinews.com/story.aspx?id=31440 ------------------------------ _______________________________________________ MSN-list mailing list MSN-list@te.verweg.com http://duvel.te.verweg.com/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/msn-list End of MSN-list Digest, Vol 7, Issue 143 ****************************************","Man gets prison term for theft of artwork WAILUKU - A three-month gaol term became commanded per a Lahaina man as he was condemned friday per the theft from artwork from galleries for Front Street last year.

I don't think this is the way to go. 1) It'd be good to be able to use the get_class opcode with PMCs as well as PDD15 classes. For that to Just Work, you need something hanging off the class slot of the appropriate namespace. That something is the PMCProxy. Thus it needs to be there from the start. 2) It's desirable that there is only ever one instance of PMCProxy per PMC. Then ""is this the same class"" is just a case of checking the pointers, as with PDD15 classes. Plus memory issues. 3) At the moment method lookup (for non-vtable methods, of course) is done through the namespace. We moved away from that in PDD15 classes, and with PMCProxy can do the same for methods of PMCs too. If you want to be able to have a list of methods inside PMCProxy, you need it stored somewhere runtime-accessible. If you're going to hang that data somewhere, why not just make the PMCProxy in the first place and store it in there. 4) PMCProxy also allows introspection of PMCs, not just placing them in an inheritance hierarchy. 5) It's just less code complexity to create them up-front. What was the motivation for having them instantiated lazily? > Looking at the code from another perspective, though, maybe what we've > got here is the beginning of an ""HLLSubclassable"" role that adds a > handful of Class methods to low-level PMCs. I wander if we have different thoughts of what PMCProxy is supposed to achieve. Here's what I thought: when you have a PDD15 class, you have the instance of Class and you have the instance of Object. For PMCs, you have the second of these - an instance of the PMC. PMCProxy fills in the gap - it's like the Class PMC for PDD15, only for PMCs rather than PDD15 classes. > Ultimately all PMCs need to be able to respond to inspect_str. Yeah, but there you're inspecting the object, not the class. Those are different, I think? > And ultimately, all PMCs need to have an entry in their NameSpace so > the type IDs can go away entirely.

Cruise, during a famously heated debate on NBC's ""Today"" show in 2005, criticized Brooke Shields for taking anti-depression drugs and berated host Matt Lauer for suggesting that psychiatric treatment might help some patients. ""I don't disagree with anything Tom says,"" Travolta says in the July issue of W magazine, on newsstands Friday. ""How would I have presented it? Maybe differently than how he did, but it doesn't matter. I still think that if you analyze most of the school shootings, it is not gun control. It is (psychotropic) drugs at the bottom of it."" ""I don't want to create controversy; I just have an opinion on things, and there is nothing wrong with stating your opinion if you are asked,"" he continues. ""Everyone wants that right, and because you are famous doesn't mean you have less of a right."" Travolta, who also talks of his habit of going to bed at 6 or 7 in the morning and waking in the early afternoon, says being famous has little impact on how he lives his life. ""I will tell you the things that would be the same, fame or no fame,"" he says. ""Being up all night would be the same. Liking empty restaurants, liking empty movie theaters -- unless I am starring in it."" Travolta, 53, portrays Ms. Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray,"" the adaptation of the stage musical that was spun from the 1988 John Waters film of the same name. The new film opens July 20. The role, in which he dons a fat suit and feminine garb, has added fuel to ongoing speculation about his sexuality. ""I have never been compelled to share with you my bathroom habits or share with you my bedroom habits,"" says the married father of two. ""Everyone has a right to privacy, so I have never felt -- even though I am famous -- that I had to share that with anybody."" Do the rumors bother him? Does he think they've affected his career? ""No and no,"" he says. ""What affects your career is the quality of the product. I don't think anyone can hurt me.""

"Sender: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca Errors-To: speakup-bounces@braille.uwo.ca Hi all, My father is a person who expects Windows XP to be on my machine every day. The deal is. I bought a new gateway in April origenally intended to be the replacement Windows machine. But I have been considering running Linux natively entirely alone on it, and whiping Windows, and perhaps virtually running it instaead. Problem is, My dad, who cannot understand much less begin to learn Linux, cannot stand anything then Windows. I considered turning my pentium into a Windows box again, but relaly cannot aford to lose Linux on that box either. A couple of months agoe, my dad logged in to my box, expecting a desktop, start menu, etc. He saw a Linux log interminal, prompting for a password. So he shut the system down improperly. After that, I had to restore Windows from a clone. I have done this too many times! And now I am being told by my dad who owns the electrical power (and who could kick my but and such) that I cannot, run Linux, whatsoever) and that he may unplug/ground me off the computer. Any suggestions? This is really an act of unfairness! But how can I explain to a sighted man who has a tempor and who cannot stand Linux or anything different? Thanks!

"GDTI: One Breakthrough Technology; Two Huge Markets GDTI: One Breakthrough Technology; Two Huge Markets For additional information, please visit Guardian Technologies' Online Investor Center Greetings, When an emerging public company develops a single technology that both identifies previously undetectable early-stage cancers as well as explosives at airport security checkpoints, investors see the upside of two multibillion markets. While these two settings seem totally unrelated, they have something very important in common: both rely on images produced from x-ray scanners or other imaging hardware platforms. While imaging technology is more advanced than ever, and radiologists and airport screeners are trained to identify objects of interest, some objects are simply too small or too difficult to identify with just the human eye. Enter Guardian Technology International (OTCBB: GDTI), developer of an industry-first technology that is significantly improving the way healthcare and homeland security professionals detect disease states in the human body and deadly threats in baggage to save lives. At market close on Friday, we announced a key patent filing for our premier Signature Mapping product. The exciting science behind Signature Mapping is truly remarkable because it can be seamlessly installed into commonly used imaging hardware platforms. But before I get into that I think its important for you to understand the products real world applications. Quickly and easily identifies tumors, cancers and other diseases that were previously not visible by radiologists Detecting diseases earlier means that patients receive treatments preemptively, a proven factor for saving lives and effectively fighting diseases Eliminating human error means reducing unnecessary and sometimes painful and emotionally distressing medical procedures Proven to identify even difficult to distinguish cancers, such as in dense breast tissue and intracranial hemorrhagic associated with brain trauma Airport security agents can quickly and easily tell the difference between everyday liquid products like hair gel and liquid explosives, drugs and other contraband Eliminating false alarms means that long lines at airport security baggage scanners and checkpoints are immediately shortened Identifying actual threats in real-time means that security personnel can react more quickly and potentially save hundreds of lives As an investor you can understand the powerful advantages of being the first company in the world to offer this uniquely disruptive technology. You are probably wondering exactly how this technology actually works. Signature Mapping analyzes images and identifies subtle energy differences in various tissues, liquids or solids and provides the viewer with additional image information not discernible with the human eye. It provides a bolded call-out on the viewing screen that clearly identifies the material in question, whether C4 explosive or a minute cancer cell. You can learn more about the science behind our technology by visiting our website at www.guardiantechintl.com. Rarely will you find a company that has technology with this type of market interchangeabilityas appropriate and vital to Homeland Security as it is to the Healthcare sector. This diversification of markets should give investors confidence that a myriad of revenue streams are both available and waiting for our technology.

"+ SPECIAL 100% DEPOSIT BONUS + COUPON CODE WD500 Poker has gone through many exciting developments throughout the past few years. More and more people have been getting interested in the game; these players generally understand more about poker and about the importance of not being too predictable. With hands like pair of aces, kings or queens, it&#8217;s easy to become readable and under these situations, the other players can easily guess what you are dealing with. Don&#8217;t play in such a stereotypical way! You could have an 8-10 pair in your hand, and reach a big monster like ace-king! In this case, not only can the pre-flop be decisive, but the board as well. Our advice is not to be too selective with your opening hand, trying to hit more: your advantage is to be unpredictable. Is it better to emphasize more on the flop or on the opening hand? And how should you adapt to the post-flop strategy? It always pays to be aggressive on the pre-flop! Sometimes you have to face opponents playing quite bad in post-flop, and in this case, you can use the situation to your advantage. Put maximum pressure on them, and make them ask themselves lots of questions, get them to pay in order to discover if you are bluffing or not. This is the very essence of Poker, mainly of no-Limit: making your opponents play, not the cards! Good cards are not there to wait for you all the time: you have to seize your opportunity the moment you feel that your opponent can be easily defeated.

Precautionary measures are being taken to guard against concerted attacks by politically-minded (or well-paid) hackers looking to cause havoc.

Parts of the internet, for example, may be unreachable or unreliable for certain countries. Regardless, the article suggests we've already seen our first low-level cyberwar in Estonia: ""The cyberattacks in Estonia were apparently sparked by tensions over the country's plan to remove Soviet-era war memorials. Estonian officials initially blamed Russia for the attacks, suggesting that its state-run computer networks blocked online access to banks and government offices. The Kremlin denied the accusations. And Estonian officials ultimately accepted the idea that perhaps this attack was the work of tech-savvy activists, or 'hactivists,' who have been mounting similar attacks against just about everyone for several years.""

Precautionary measures are being taken to guard against concerted attacks by politically-minded (or well-paid) hackers looking to cause havoc. Though they outline scenarios where mass damage is the desired outcome (such as remotely opening a dam's floodgates to flood cities), largest expect such conflicts to be more subtle. Parts of the internet, for example, may be unreachable or unreliable for certain countries. Regardless, the article suggests we've currently watched our firstly low-rise cyberwar in Estonia: ""The cyberattacks in Estonia were apparently sparked by tensions over the country's plan to remove Soviet-era war memorials. Estonian officials initially blamed Russia for the attacks, suggesting that its government-run equipment networks obstructed online accessibility into banks and government offices. The Kremlin denied the accusations. And Estonian officials ultimately accepted the idea that perhaps this attack was the work of tech-savvy activists, or 'hactivists,' who have been mounting similar attacks against just about everyone for several years.""

I would suggest cleavage each record towards ""\n"", looping beyond the results verifying to see if the first typeface is a space, and enclosing that line to the last field if y is or establishing a new key/value pair if it isn't. ; To unsubscribe, e-mail: beginners-unsubscribe@perl.org For additional commands, e-mail: beginners-help@perl.org http://learn.perl.org/",Ham,No,943,1014,52.388888888888886,59.64705882352941,4.6,4.946341463414634,287,310,15.944444444444445,18.235294117647058,1.4,1.5121951219512195,74.14634146341463,68.29268292682927,10.731707317073171,13.658536585365855,7.317073170731707,8.292682926829269,3.414634146341464,5.365853658536586,0.10371295371295372,0.10179063360881542,0.41555111555111546,0.4034435261707989,55.07,38.28,58.661417322834644,51.75097276264592,56.60754048582996,91.69864726611345,38.976377952755904,34.63035019455253,11.41732283464567,12.840466926070038,3.937007874015748,3.11284046692607,21.653543307086615,22.17898832684825,7.874015748031496,6.614785992217899,4.330708661417323,5.058365758754864,10.236220472440944,10.116731517509727,7.874015748031496,8.171206225680933,2.3622047244094486,2.7237354085603114,1.968503937007874,1.9455252918287937,8.661417322834646,8.560311284046692,0.0,0.0

Hash data items are retrieved in the ""natural"" order in which they're stored in the hash. It's hard to say what that order is, but we know what it's not. It's not alphabetical order, and it's not the order that elements were stored into the hash. It's not random order, which might be nice, and it's not sorted by value, as convenient as that would be. It's not an order that is sure to be the same for every release of Perl, for every implementation of Perl, or even every time you run your program with the same perl binary on the same OS on the same day. It's not any order that's useful for anybody but Perl, in fact, so we may as well say it's in no order at all. But it is in _some_ order; keys(), values(), and each() all use the same, repeatable, order (at least, until you add new items to the hash). If you need any particular order, of course, that's easy to get. You can either sort items directly into the order you want, or you could use a module that keeps a hash in order for you.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! A few hours after I arrived home in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, I received word that Officer Bobby Cutts had confessed to the murder of Jessie Davis and her baby. One of my producers had remained behind in Ohio so that we could still closely follow the story and he kept me up to date as the early news was breaking. Yes, it is what we all suspected but we had until that news harbored a small piece of hope that Jessie had been kidnapped and was still alive. Murder seemed most likely, but we all hoped it would be one of those freak cases like Elizabeth Smart where the most predictable was just plain wrong. As you know, on Thursday and Friday we were in Ohio. I have posted some still pictures that will give you a good idea of what our Friday was like as we covered the story... step by step. ' target=""_blank"" photoessay=""photoessay"">Click here to check out my photo essay We wanted to speak to the friend (owner of a barber shop) of Officer Cutts who was with him at the bar the night Jessie last spoke to her mother on the phone. So, we went to his barber shop early in the morning to see if we could get an interview. We numbered about seven with our camera crew and audio, and did not want to overwhelm him as we all entered so as to eliminate any chance of an interview. Thus, we sent Ted in to see if he could get the interview for us and we waited outside a short distance away. We waited in a grassy and un-kept area and found a broken down picnic table to set up as our ""office."" See the pics. While in our outdoor office, a yellow cat found us. See the pics. She was extremely friendly. Since we had some time on our hands, we dispatched one of our group to go to a store, buy a cat dish and some cat food. In the pics you can see that we left a very grateful cat. We debated whether to take her to an animal shelter, but the cat was so friendly that we decided she lived in the area and was merely curious about us. The cat was not wild. Click here to watch the video blog: you get a glimpse of this cat in action. Note: it just occurred to me that we seem to find lots of animals when we are on the road: A monkey in Aruba that we fed daily; a puppy that we rescued from a roof while we were in New Orleans covering Katrina. After spending a few hours waiting to get an interview with the barber, we gave up. The barber said he would only talk to us for money which seemed a bit odd since he maintained that he was a friend of Bobby's and that Bobby did nothing wrong. Of course we offered no money. We finally left the barber shop late morning (to return later) and went to lunch with the crew. See the pics. After lunch we moved to our second ""office"" the parking lot of the Bob Evans restaurant (see pic). Gathering in the parking lot, we strategized about what we should do to continue to cover the missing Jessie Davis story. We decided to interview one of Officer Cutts' prior girlfriend's lawyers (see pic) and then go back to the barber shop late in the day to see if our luck changed with the barber. The barber was important since he was with Cutts Wednesday night. We were immensely curious what Officer Cutts was like on Wednesday night at the bar, when he left and with whom. I wanted to know if he talked about Jesse while he sat at the bar... and, if so, what did he say? Yes, we went back... and yes, no interview from the barber. About 6 p.m. we returned to the fire department which was ground zero for the searchers. You can see the pics of the firehouse with the searchers and the ton of donated food and water. The fire department is where we decided to do our 10 p.m. show because it was the location of our satellite truck (which we need for transmission for the show.) I can't say enough good things about the searchers: the volunteer fire department and Texas Equusearch. Texas Equusearch has the search down to a science. They are extremely well organized, which you must be when the area to search is vast and you have about 2000 volunteers. Friday night on the show we read some of your e-mails on air and answered them. As I read many of those emails I thought, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" One that stands out is the e-mail that mentioned that because the ""event"" (now murder) probably occurred in the second floor bedroom, it seemed reasonable to assume that she knew the person well enough to let him not only in the house, but upstairs to her bedroom. This would mitigate against her kidnapper (now known to be murderer) being a stranger.

James Avant Las Vegas, NV Finally, some articles that caught my attention: Olympic sprinter Marion Jones is broke LOS ANGELES (AP) Seven years after winning a women's record five Olympic track and field medals and snagging multimillion-dollar endorsement deals, Marion Jones is broke. The sprinter is heavily in debt, fighting off court judgments and down to a bank balance of about $2,000, according to recent court records reviewed by the Los Angeles Times. Last year a bank foreclosed on her $2.5-million mansion in an area of Chapel Hill, N.C., where Michael Jordan was a neighbor. She was also forced to sell two other properties, including her mother's house, to raise money. Jones' financial woes were revealed in a 168-page deposition in a breach-of-contract suit she filed in Dallas against veteran track coach Dan Pfaff. Pfaff countersued and won a judgment against Jones for about $240,000 in unpaid training fees and legal expenses. Legal bills have plagued Jones since 2003, when suspicions of drug use emerged and she was linked to the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative (BALCO) after a federal raid. Jones retained attorneys for her BALCO grand jury testimony, for negotiations with the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency in her fight to avoid being banned from competition, for a defamation lawsuit she filed against BALCO founder Victor Conte, who accused her of taking performance-enhancing drugs, and for taking on Pfaff in her breach-of-contract suit. Last year, a Jones urine sample tested positive for the performance-enhancing drug EPO. Jones immediately quit a European track tour and returned to the United States. Although she was cleared when a backup sample tested negative, she missed at least five major international meets, forfeiting an estimated $300,000 in appearance and performance fees. In her prime, Jones was one of track's first female millionaires, typically earning between $70,000 and $80,000 a race, plus at least another $1 million from race bonuses and endorsement deals. In 2000-01, she competed in 21 international events, including the Sydney Olympics, where she won five medals three gold.

Ex-classmate of murder suspect in pregnant-woman case arrested By JOE MILICIA, Associated Press Writer CANTON, Ohio (AP) A former high-school classmate of the man suspected of murdering a pregnant woman was arrested Sunday on an obstruction of justice charge, the FBI said. Myisha Ferrell, 29, was arrested in the death of 26-year-old Jessie Davis the day after sheriff's deputies and FBI agents with a search warrant broke down the door of her apartment Saturday night, agent Scott Wilson said. She was not at home during the search. The Stark County Sheriff's Department said she is charged with obstructing deputies and agents but provided no other details, saying any information made public would hurt their case. Ferrell was to be arraigned Monday, Wilson said. The maximum penalty for obstruction of justice is five years in prison. The Summit County medical examiner on Sunday identified a body found in Cuyahoga Valley National Park as that of Davis. The dead, nearly full-term fetus was still in her womb. Davis, of Lake Township near Canton, was reported missing after her mother found Davis' 2-year-old son, Blake, home alone, with bedroom furniture toppled and bleach spilled on the floor. Blake gave investigators their first clues, saying: ""Mommy was crying. Mommy broke the table. Mommy's in rug."" Thousands of volunteers searched for Davis for several days, while investigators questioned Bobby Cutts Jr., 30, a police officer who is Davis' boyfriend and has an estranged wife. He is scheduled to be arraigned Monday. Davis' relatives have said they believed Cutts, of North Canton, was the father of both Blake and the fetus Davis was carrying. Justin Lindstrom, 27, an upstairs neighbor of Ferrell's, said officers spent two hours searching the woman's apartment before leaving with several full, brown paper bags and bottles of bleach from the basement. Lindstrom said he had not seen the downstairs tenant on Saturday or Sunday and rarely spoke to the woman, except to ask her to turn her music down. He said he didn't notice anything out of the ordinary around the time Davis disappeared. Lindstrom said Ferrell lives with her 11-year-old daughter. Lindstorm said the two of them never hit it off. ""She's not exactly your ideal neighbor. She and I haven't gotten along since day one,"" said Lindstrom, who moved into the building in January. He said she had parties every night. ""We're talking carloads at a time four and five carloads and until 3 or 4 in the morning,"" Lindstrom said. Wilson would not describe what the deputies seized or say how Ferrell might have been involved. There was no immediate response to messages seeking comment Sunday from Davis' family members and Cutts' lawyer. Cutts' pastor, the Rev. C.A. Richmond, declined to comment as he entered a services in Canton on Sunday. Davis' body was found in an area known as Top O' the World because of its elevation. The area contains a dirt road, a small dirt parking area and a couple of benches overlooking a grassy field. The body was found in that field, said Roger Riggins, an investigator for the medical examiner's office. Just down the road, someone posted a sign that said, ""God bless you Jessie and Chloe, forever in our hearts."" People had placed flowers and red and yellow ribbons just below a sign identifying the park. Associated Press Writers Rachel Hoag and John McCarthy contributed to this report.

(AP) A handful of swallow nests might hold up construction work on a Shawano County bridge indefinitely. Work on the Tigerton bridge was scheduled to begin tomorrow. But on Friday the contractor found a number of nests on the structure's underside. That caused a delay until state officials could decide how to work around them. Federal law prohibits destroying the nests. So construction has been delayed until the county gets permission from the Department of Fish and Wildlife. The county highway commissioner says officials didn't expect to find nests because county workers had installed nets in April to prevent birds from nesting there. He says there was a hole in the netting but he didn't know whether it was weather-related or vandalism. Officials don't expect a big delay. They note that even if the workers can't disturb the swallows, there's other work they can still do in the meantime.

And check out my pod cast on iTunes! A few hours after I arrived home in Washington, D.C., on Saturday, I received word that Officer Bobby Cutts had confessed to the murder of Jessie Davis and her baby. One of my producers had remained behind in Ohio so that we could still closely follow the story and he kept me up to date as the early news was breaking. Yes, it is what we all suspected but we had until that news harbored a small piece of hope that Jessie had been kidnapped and was still alive. Murder seemed most likely, but we all hoped it would be one of those freak cases like Elizabeth Smart where the most predictable was just plain wrong. As you know, on Thursday and Friday we were in Ohio. I have posted some still pictures that will give you a good idea of what our Friday was like as we covered the story... step by step. ' target=""_blank"" photoessay=""photoessay"">Click here to check out my photo essay We wanted to speak to the friend (owner of a barber shop) of Officer Cutts who was with him at the bar the night Jessie last spoke to her mother on the phone. So, we went to his barber shop early in the morning to see if we could get an interview. We numbered about seven with our camera crew and audio, and did not want to overwhelm him as we all entered so as to eliminate any chance of an interview. Thus, we sent Ted in to see if he could get the interview for us and we waited outside a short distance away. We waited in a grassy and un-kept area and found a broken down picnic table to set up as our ""office."" See the pics. While in our outdoor office, a yellow cat found us. See the pics. She was extremely friendly. Since we had some time on our hands, we dispatched one of our group to go to a store, buy a cat dish and some cat food. In the pics you can see that we left a very grateful cat. We debated whether to take her to an animal shelter, but the cat was so friendly that we decided she lived in the area and was merely curious about us. The cat was not wild. Click here to watch the video blog: you get a glimpse of this cat in action. Note: it just occurred to me that we seem to find lots of animals when we are on the road: A monkey in Aruba that we fed daily; a puppy that we rescued from a roof while we were in New Orleans covering Katrina. After spending a few hours waiting to get an interview with the barber, we gave up. The barber said he would only talk to us for money which seemed a bit odd since he maintained that he was a friend of Bobby's and that Bobby did nothing wrong. Of course we offered no money. We finally left the barber shop late morning (to return later) and went to lunch with the crew. See the pics. After lunch we moved to our second ""office"" the parking lot of the Bob Evans restaurant (see pic). Gathering in the parking lot, we strategized about what we should do to continue to cover the missing Jessie Davis story. We decided to interview one of Officer Cutts' prior girlfriend's lawyers (see pic) and then go back to the barber shop late in the day to see if our luck changed with the barber. The barber was important since he was with Cutts Wednesday night. We were immensely curious what Officer Cutts was like on Wednesday night at the bar, when he left and with whom. I wanted to know if he talked about Jesse while he sat at the bar... and, if so, what did he say? Yes, we went back... and yes, no interview from the barber. About 6 p.m. we returned to the fire department which was ground zero for the searchers. You can see the pics of the firehouse with the searchers and the ton of donated food and water. The fire department is where we decided to do our 10 p.m. show because it was the location of our satellite truck (which we need for transmission for the show.) I can't say enough good things about the searchers: the volunteer fire department and Texas Equusearch. Texas Equusearch has the search down to a science. They are extremely well organized, which you must be when the area to search is vast and you have about 2000 volunteers. Friday night on the show we read some of your e-mails on air and answered them. As I read many of those emails I thought, ""Why didn't I think of that?"" One that stands out is the e-mail that mentioned that because the ""event"" (now murder) probably occurred in the second floor bedroom, it seemed reasonable to assume that she knew the person well enough to let him not only in the house, but upstairs to her bedroom. This would mitigate against her kidnapper (now known to be murderer) being a stranger. This thinking was not proof that it was a known person to her, but rather important analysis and of course it turns out it was true. I am sure you read that a second person has been arrested in connection with the murder of Jessoe, we will tell you more about it tonight on the show.

I'm not putting Linux online until I have a decent iptables firewall up and running. I already have the script, only it's copied from a Firefox session in Windows.

It is easier if you download and build the modules by hand (rather than try to use CPAN). Just get the module to the point of ""make install"" and copy the directory over. Just make sure you install any dependencies first.

The joint venture plan calls for a China-based alliance partner to invest in the building of a wafer production operation to serve the larger semiconductor device manufacturing community in China.

Coli. This data will be used in bioinformatics research to generate a Markov Matrix. However, I am just beginning PERL and ran into a slight problem. Basically, I need the frequencies of the 4 bases, Adenosine (A), Thymine (T), Cytosine (C), and Guanine (G). I made a PERL script to tally up the total counts of the bases. In my case, there are 6254 Adenosine, 4957 Thymine, 4245 Cytosine, and 3534 Guanine. In order to find the frequencies, all I would do is divide each base count by the total. However, here is my problem. Instead of doing it globally. I need to be able to specify an arbitrary start and stop position to start tallying the occurences of the bases and also to find the frequencies of the bases in that particularly defined area. Herein lies my problem. I have not a clue how to go about doing this task. I've been looking online for a solution but haven't really found one.

"X-MIME-Autoconverted: from quoted-printable to 8bit by flax9.uwaterloo.ca id l5RCiUL9026644 Hi all, I am using Net::SFTP package to remotely connect to a local SFTP server (on a LAN) and retreive files from it toward another LAN shared folder.

I am trying to retreive a file stored in a subfolder of the home directory but: 1) I did not find a way to move to that folder. There is no ""cd"" command with SFTP package ?? I did not find anything in the cpan doc. 2) The file is never retreived when using the $sftp->get() function. I systematically get the error message ""No such file or directory"". I tried virtual pathes, absolute pathes but nothing works :( Here is my script: #Paramtres de connexion my $host = xx.xx.xxx.xxx'; my %args = (user => ""toto"", password => ""pass"", ssh_args => [port=>22]); #Cration de l'en tte de la requte my $sftp = Net::SFTP->new($host, %args) or die ""Cannot connect to $@""; print ""Connected.\n""; #Rcupration de la date du jour my $dateJour = formatDate(); $sftp->ls('.' , sub { print $_[0]->{filename}, ""\n"" }); #On se positionne dans le rpertoire $sftp->get(""rep/Export.csv"", ""\\\\share\\Exports Annuaires\\Export $dateJour.csv"") or die ""Impossible de copier le fichier. Error : $!\n""; In the script, I display the folders of the home directory, which is working (as explained earlier). But if I try to display the files stored in the subfolder, I get the same folder listing: I don't understand. This folder is called rep, and that is the folder from where I am trying to retreive a file when I call the get function. My shared folder is available as the destination file is correctly created (Export 2007 06 27.csv for example) but allways empty. And I am working on windows ;) Am I doing something wrong ? Could someone help me ?

EX TREME MOTORSPORTS Sym: ETMO.PK Current $0.0006 5 Day $0.03 E xtreme Motorsports of California, Inc. Completes Acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services June 27, 2:00 pm ET BAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- Extrem e Motorsports of California, Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) (""Ext reme"" or the ""Company""), has completed the acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC (""SOVS""), a company dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road vehicles. Through this acquisition, Extreme will not only be able to offer its customers direct financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first sandcar manufacturer As previously announced, in exchange for all of the capital stock of SOVS, Ex treme has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million shares of Extr eme common stock. Of the 15 million share of common stock, 10 million will be restricted shares of common stock and 5 million will be free-trading shares. In the past, Ex treme required customer down-payments at contract signing and final payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required Extrem e to finance the 12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow of the company. Now, Ext reme will be able to achieve both greater throughput and profit margins by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has currently secured $14 million in financing for future customers of Extr eme, both for direct purchases and for leased vehicles. This will provide Extrem e with immediate funding for the build-out of custom sandcars for private customers and ""spec"" vehicles for its dealers. ""The acquisition of SOVS provides Ex treme with the capability to deliver direct financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard over-the-road vehicles,"" commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of E xtreme Motorsports. ""Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar manufacturer in the world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. This not only ensures consistent operating cash flows to Extrem e, but incentivizes buyers who might otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to complete a purchase immediately through consumer financing."" About Ext reme Motorsports of California, Inc. Ex treme Motorsports of California, Inc., operating under the trade name ""Xtreme Motorsports,"" is a manufacturer of custom and production-line sandrails, desert and dual sport racecars.

EXTREM E MOTORSPORTSSym: ETMO.PKCurrent $0.00065 Day $0.03 E XTREME Motorsports of California, Inc. Completes Acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle ServicesJune 27, 2:00 pm ET BAKERSFIELD, CA--(MARKET WIRE)--Jun 27, 2007 -- EXTR EME Motorsports of California, Inc. (Other OTC:ETMO.PK - News) (""EXTREM E"" or the ""Company""), has completed the acquisition of Southern Offroad Vehicle Services, LLC (""SOVS""), a company dedicated to providing financing for customers purchasing off-road vehicles. Through this acquisition, EXTRE ME will not only be able to offer its customers direct financing of sandcar purchases, but will also be the first sandcar manufacturer As previously announced, in exchange for all of the capital stock of SOVS, EXTRE ME has paid $10,000 in cash and 15 million shares of EX TREME common stock. Of the 15 million share of common stock, 10 million will be restricted shares of common stock and 5 million will be free-trading shares. In the past, EXTR EME required customer down-payments at contract signing and final payment upon acceptance of the final vehicle, which required EXT REME to finance the 12-month or more build-out process through the operating cash flow of the company. Now, EXTR EME will be able to achieve both greater throughput and profit margins by shifting its financing costs to the customer. SOVS has currently secured $14 million in financing for future customers of EXTREM E, both for direct purchases and for leased vehicles. This will provide EX TREME with immediate funding for the build-out of custom sandcars for private customers and ""spec"" vehicles for its dealers. ""The acquisition of SOVS provides EXTR EME with the capability to deliver direct financing to our customers at rates comparable to dealers of standard over-the-road vehicles,"" commented Alan McCaa, President and CEO of EXT REME Motorsports. ""Through this acquisition, we provide what no other sandcar manufacturer in the world is able to claim: in-house financing to all customers. This not only ensures consistent operating cash flows to EXTREM E, but incentivizes buyers who might otherwise defer a purchase to a later date to complete a purchase immediately through consumer financing.""

"""Sicko's"" Successful Weekend Puts My Movie in 200 More Cities Beginning Today! Tuesday, July 3rd, 2007 Friends, The results are in from the weekend -- and they are amazing! ""Sicko"" more than doubled what industry insiders had predicted it would do for the weekend and, as I predicted, it did indeed have the second largest opening weekend in film history for a documentary (after F911). It also had the second highest per screen average for the weekend (after the Pixar animated film, ""Ratatouille""). All this in spite of the fact, as Variety wrote, it's not been a very good year for documentaries at the box office. According to Variety, there have been 29 docs released in theaters in 2007, and they have grossed less than two million combined. What does it say about the state of affairs for non-fiction films if, in just three days, one film more than doubles what all 29 of them did together? I've decided I want to do something about this. I see so many great documentaries and it's a shame that most of you don't get to see them. Later this year, I will announce a new project that will help other filmmakers get the distribution they deserve. Of course, if you live in Lincoln, NE; Bangor, ME; Reno, NV; New Haven, CT; Columbia, SC; or Oklahoma City, you didn't get to see ""Sicko"" this weekend either. But thanks to the massive turnout in the 440 theaters who had it, the studio has decided to expand ""Sicko,"" TODAY (Tuesday, July 3) to 200 more theaters! And this Friday, they will add another 100 cities. Those of you who went to see it in the last few days have made it possible for others around the country to see my movie. Thank you. So this will become the make-it-or-break-it week for ""Sicko."" Will you help me? Here's something you can do right now. Go to your address book icon on your computer and send a brief note to all your friends and associates about why they should see ""Sicko."" Then organize a group of your friends to go see ""Sicko"" some night this week. I promise you that you won't be disappointed. After all, what's the worst that could happen -- a pardon or a commutation from the President of the United States? On Sunday, Canada celebrated the 45th anniversary of its free, universal health care system -- with its built-in bonus of living longer than we do. Why do they have this and not us? We've already taken their Stanley Cup from them for good. Let's demand we get to live as long as they do, too! What good is a dumb ol' Cup if we aren't around long enough to use it? The letters you are sending me are powerful and profound. Thank you for sharing with me thousands of more stories about the criminal way our system operates. One woman wrote to say her dentist just gave her this choice: have all her teeth pulled, or pay him $30,000 to fix and rebuild them. She told me she's made the choice to give up her teeth -- a choice she was forced to make only because she lives from paycheck to paycheck in middle class America. This is a crime. Go to your address book on your computer now and send out that e-mail to everyone you know and tell them to find their way to the theater this week. This film stands the chance of igniting a movement. Let's not let this moment pass.

"Sender: sugar-bounces@lists.laptop.org Errors-To: sugar-bounces@lists.laptop.org Hello, we need to have an entry in the NEWS files for each new release or snapshot we get on the images. We should not list there every single change we do to the code (that's git log), just stuff which is interesting for testers and users. Here is how I'm going to organize the process for the modules I'm handling releases for. Maintainers of other modules are encouraged to use the same format. When you commit something news worthy add an entry at the top of the NEWS file. I will add the snapshot number when I release it. * Put your irc nick at the end of the entry. * Please be picky about the format so that we don't end up with a mess and it's also easily parsable. I will add a sanity check to maint-helper.py and activities setup.py at some point to ensure this. * It's not in the examples before but if you are fixing a ticket add it at the beginning of the entry as #12345.
