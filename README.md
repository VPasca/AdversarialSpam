# AdversarialSpam
SECU0053: Security and Crime Science Research Project
This is the code for the Dissertation Project "Analysing Linguistic Features of Perturbed Emails from an Adversarial Word-level Attack"


The Requirements.txt file contains the necessary packages for training and testing the WCNN and LSTM models, executing the word-paraphrasing attack, and the analyses in Python and R. Apologies if any packages or libraries were missed.


Email me on vlad.pasca.cbu@gmail.com if encountering any errors (e.g. get data, model files etc).
