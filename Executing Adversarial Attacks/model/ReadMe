The trained WCNN and LSTM models can be downloaded from my dropbox.

To run the attacks on these models, make sure to follow the instructions from https://github.com/cecilialeiqi/adversarial_text

Accordingly, make sure to leave these models in the model folder. If you move them elsewhere, unless in the Makefile
you change the file path to where the models are stored, the attacks will not run.
